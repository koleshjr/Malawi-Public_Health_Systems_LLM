Q4,"What is the definition of ""unusual event""","Context 1: CEBS relies on reporting of unusual events and this is designed to rapidly identify whether something might be wrong in the community. Information may be incomplete, unconfirmed and may even be a rumour. The definition of an ‘unusual event’ will change from one community to another, and needs to be defined in each context. It can be one event, or a cluster of events, that may be unusual for a specific community or during a certain time of year. For example, an unusual event could be: “A cluster of deaths from an unknown cause in the same household or adjacent households”, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 434
Context 2: Is the event unusual or unexpected?, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 384
Context 3: Standard case definition ﷐These events are not well detailed or standardized at this time. In the IHR 2005 two events were chosen to help guide the surveillance functionality and allow early detection and response.  Unexplained deaths  Clusters of illness   Community Alert Triggers  Unknown health problems grouped together. Any health problem that you don’t know about that is happening to many people or animals in the same community. Examples include:  any outbreak or cluster: A group of people are sick (or die) with similar symptoms in one place (community, school, or health facility) at the same time  any unusual death or cluster of deaths: two or more people die of unknown cause after suffering from similar symptoms in one place (e.g. village, school, or HCF) at the same time  a group of people that become sick or have another unusual reaction after consuming the same food or drinking from the same water source  any person that becomes sick with symptoms that have not seen before or not seen for a long time (e.g. an emerging infectious disease is suspected)  community member(s) become sick around the time that animals are sick or die in  their village  Sick or dead animals of unknown cause   Health Facilities  The proposed definition for events to be reported by clinicians and health care facilities is: “Any outbreak of disease, OR any uncommon illness of potential public health concern, OR any infectious or infectious-like syndrome considered unusual by the clinician, based on frequency, circumstances of occurrence, clinical presentation, or severity”.    Any infectious or infectious-like syndrome considered unusual by the clinician based on:  Frequency- e.g., a sudden unexplained, significant increase in the number of patients, especially when it occurs outside the normal season.  Circumstances of occurrence – e.g., many patients coming from the same location or participating in similar activities.  Clinical presentation- e.g., a patient’s health rapidly deteriorating out of proportion to the presenting symptoms and diagnosis. Severity – e.g., a number of patients failing to respond to treatments.  Patient with history of exposure to animals (wild or domestic) that presents with unusual clinical presentation   , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 294"
Q5,What is Community Based Surveillance (CBS)?,"Context 1: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 431
Context 2: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 86
Context 3: Steps for establishing Community Based Surveillance (CBS) , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 438"
Q9,What kind of training should members of VHC receive?,"Context 1: Train VHCs in surveillance and response skills as well as improved Interpersonal skills, using interactive training, adult learning techniques and role playing. Use of cell-phone based opportunities to play MP3s or other video clips can be helpful during training and in the community. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 456
Context 2: Any community member acceptable by the community can be VHC. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of CBS. Representation could be from basic village-level services such as community health volunteers, community health workers, trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, health extension workers, chemical sellers, and traditional healers and in other communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper or  who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.  , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 467
Context 3: Once selected, the VHCs should receive training and carry out their role on how to recognize certain diseases or health conditions for the purpose of reporting suspect cases. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 468"
Q10,What is indicator based surveillance (IBS)?,"Context 1: Indicator-Based surveillance (IBS) involves reports of specific diseases from health care providers to public health officials. Such information may be described as structured information because the information obtained is standardized., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 137
Context 2: 1.2 Indicator-based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches used to detect priority diseases, conditions and events, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 135
Context 3: Event-based Surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) are components of Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR) and epidemic intelligence incorporated in the IDSR strategy. Both EBS and IBS are complimentary with each having a different role to play and purpose. EBS is most likely to pick up alerts to detect small outbreaks early, while IBS is better in monitoring disease trends over time and useful for signalling the start of regular seasonal outbreaks of endemic diseases using alert and epidemic thresholds. IBS may not be useful for smaller events because alerts are either averaged out in large data sets, or lost in smaller data sets. EBS is also better at picking up alerts indicating outbreaks in areas where access to healthcare is limited. In the context of IDSR strategy, the flow of EBS information follows the same reporting lines as IBS i.e. from community to health facility to district and to national level. EBS and IBS are applied at all levels of the health system namely community, health facility, district and national levels (Illustrated in figure 2)., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 99"
Q13,What is Case based surveillance?,"Context 1: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 81
Context 2: Record information of all cases on a “case based surveillance reporting form” (See sample Annex 2F). At least record the following:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 312
Context 3: Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 88"
Q14,What diseases are best monitored using syndromic surveillance?,"Context 1: Syndromic surveillance: An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or ""rash illness"" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 83
Context 2: Public health laboratory system complements the syndromic disease surveillance. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 642
Context 3: Alexey V. Burdakov*, Andrey O. Ukharov and Thomas G. Wahl. One-Health Surveillance with Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance System. ISDS 2012 Conference Abstracts , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 727"

Context 3: Steps for establishing Community Based Surveillance (CBS) , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 438"
Q17,What do Village Health Commitees (VHCs) do when they identify a patient through any of the strategies?,"Context 1: Describe how communication about surveillance and response takes place and will be tracked between the health facility IDSR focal person and the VHCs. For literate VHCs, design simple alert forms (See Annex 2C) and show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 457
Context 2: All community based health workers, VHCs, including traditional birth attendants, school teachers, pharmacists, who have trusted relationships with the local community. They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 485
Context 3: supervise activities of the VHCs including the fine tune understanding of the case definitions. In case, VHCs are used for contact tracing, ensure the facility based person leads the process in collaboration with the health facility based person. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 480"
Q18,In Community Based Surveillance what kind of unusual events or alerts are of interest?,"Context 1: Unlike indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is not based on the routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action but rather on the screening of ALL available information to detect any event happening in the community (unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual or clustering of cases, events/conditions in the community, including environmental conditions). , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 94
Context 2: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members.

Q20,Give examples of members of Village Health Commitees (VHAs).,"Context 1: Any community member acceptable by the community can be VHC. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of CBS. Representation could be from basic village-level services such as community health volunteers, community health workers, trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, health extension workers, chemical sellers, and traditional healers and in other communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper or  who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.  , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 467

They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 485
Context 3: Identify Community key informants (CHW) for each source of information in collaboration with the community. Identify and specify the opportunities for community involvement in surveillance of health events and the role of the VHCs. the volunteers should be people who are trusted by the community, committed to ‘zero-case’ reporting, and they should be reassured that reporting bad news won’t get them into trouble, hence no need to falsify data , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 451"
Q22,How are community health workers identified?,"Context 1: Community health workers , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 627
Context 2: Instructions: This form is completed by a Community health worker or ComBaS key informant and submitted immediately to nearest health facility IDSR focal person when he or she identifies disease (s) or public health event as per the community case definition. It is also completed for unusual health events/alerts that are not captured by the given case definition. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 677
Context 3: Community health workers if already exist or an identified community volunteer to verify age  , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1128"
Q26,Why do CHWs play a crucial role in Community Based Surveillance?,"Context 1: Identify Community key informants (CHW) for each source of information in collaboration with the community. Identify and specify the opportunities for community involvement in surveillance of health events and the role of the VHCs. the volunteers should be people who are trusted by the community, committed to ‘zero-case’ reporting, and they should be reassured that reporting bad news won’t get them into trouble, hence no need to falsify data , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 451
Context 2: Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 119
Context 3: Both systems should be established to ensure all information from the community is captured and quickly reported to a designated surveillance focal person at the next level for follow up. Moreover, these two elements of surveillance should be integrated at the community level., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 437"
Q27,What is the procedure of reporting cases for VHCs?,"Context 1: supervise activities of the VHCs including the fine tune understanding of the case definitions. In case, VHCs are used for contact tracing, ensure the facility based person leads the process in collaboration with the health facility based person. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 480
Context 2: To report all available essential information immediately to the appropriate level of healthcare response (within 24 hours). At the community level, VHC shall report to the appropriate health facility in the respective catchment area. At the primary public health response level, reporting shall be to the intermediate or national response level, depending on organizational structures., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 502
Context 3: Once selected, the VHCs should receive training and carry out their role on how to recognize certain diseases or health conditions for the purpose of reporting suspect cases. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 468"
Q31,Mention a role of the community volunteers and  Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs).,"Context 1: Roles and Responsibilities of community volunteer and Health Surveillance Assistant, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 532
Context 2: Roles of Community Health Volunteers/Structures:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1667
Context 3: Community health workers (including Animal Health Surveillance Assistants), Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 319"
Q36,What defined a probable case?,"Context 1: Probable case: clear clinical picture (meets the clinical case definition) i.e., patient will have typical clinical features of the illness or linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case but a laboratory sample cannot be taken because the case is lost or dead or a sample has been taken but not available for laboratory testing or was not viable for sufficient laboratory testing or test results is inconclusive or staff are not able to take a sample for some reasons., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 155
Context 2: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 158
Context 3: Confirmed case: a suspected or probable case verified by laboratory analysis, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 156"
Q37,What defined a confirmed case?,"Context 1: Confirmed case: a suspected or probable case verified by laboratory analysis, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 156
Context 2: 4.3.1 Define a Case, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 296
Context 3: Alert Case	❑ Suspect	❑ Probable	❑ Confirmed	❑ Not a case, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 470"
Q38,What is the guidelines with regards to the sensitivity of case definitions in outbreak scenarios?,"Context 1: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 158
Context 2: For the diseases, conditions, and events already included on the IDSR priority disease list, the existing case definitions should be used. Sensitive case definitions that increase the chances of detecting new outbreaks should be developed for the additional diseases, conditions, events, and syndromes identified as part of the risk assessment. These case definitions should be simple, standardized, and harmonized with the national IDSR case definitions. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 166
Context 3: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 297"
Q40,What does One Health approach consist of?,"Context 1: ·   One Health: The One Health approach offers an innovative approach where various disciplines work together to address health at the human-animal-environment interface. In view of the fact that the majority of emerging and re-emerging infections are often zoonosis and responsible for large outbreaks in recent times, maintaining a focus on diseases that affect both humans and animals is a worthwhile investment. MOH is exploring potential technology solutions (i.e. mobile application, EMR automate disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, drone technology, etc.) to reach the One Health surveillance goal. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 582
Context 2: One Health is an approach to address a shared health threat at the human-animal-environment interface based on collaboration, communication, and coordination across all relevant sectors and disciplines, with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal health outcomes for both people and animals. A One Health approach applies to the local, regional, national, and global levels. Humans and animals (domestic and wildlife) share the same eco-system and the opportunities for spill-over of diseases are increasing with modern trends in globalization, growing population pressures, climate change, economic development, mass urbanization, and increasing demand for animal-sourced foods.  , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 150
Context 3: The One Health approach is intrinsic to and strongly reinforced by WHO’s IHR (2005) and the IDSR strategy as well as other global health frameworks. The One Health approach applies toward improving indicator and event-based surveillance, which is cornerstone for the early warning function of the IDSR. Animal and human health workers as well as other relevant partners should be engaged at various levels to be information sources for IDSR to further facilitate information sharing and joint rapid response activities.  The One Health approach offers a comprehensive framework for IHR (2005) implementation, helping to address Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of all sources. The key principles of the One Health approach include prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases (reference to internationally adopted standards i.e. IHR (2005) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) international standards), and support for national public health services and build on the existing structures.  , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 151"
Q41,Give an example of One Health surveillance?,"Context 1: Disease-specific surveillance: This involves surveillance activities aimed at targeted health data for a specific disease for vertical surveillance. Examples include Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV surveillance systems., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 85

Context 3: 1.2.1 Definition of the different types/approaches of public health surveillance, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 73"
Q42,How are case definitions disseminated for use in Malawi?,"Context 1: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 297
Context 2: Malawi is using posters, small-sized booklet and IDSR technical guidelines to disseminate case definitions for diseases under surveillance. These tools reinforce the use of standard case definitions for detecting and reporting priority diseases, conditions and events., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 168
Context 3: Disease-specific case-based reporting forms for particular diseases and conditions of concern (for example: AFP, cholera, VHF, maternal death, and MDR/XDR TB) are in the annex at the end of Section 11 of these 3rd Malawi IDSR TG. These forms may be used to begin gathering initial information for the case investigation., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 532"
Q46,How often are the district procedures for surveillance and response updated?,"Context 1: 1.5 Update district procedures for surveillance and response	9, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 26
Context 2: 1.5 Update district procedures for surveillance and response, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 186
Context 3:    surveillance and response in the district. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 397"
Q47,"What is the recommended frequency for updating information about the catchment area, including health facilities, Points of Entry, and laboratories?","Context 1: At least annually, update information about the catchment area (health facilities, PoE, laboratories). This activity should be part of the health planning at district, as well as national level. Make sure there is a description on local population characteristics in the catchment area, what activities are happening, what risks should be accounted for, and what surveillance assets and gaps exist. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 189
Context 2: To update the catchment area description, make sure you have current information about:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 192
Context 3: As you conduct updates of the catchment area description, check to see that all reporting sites have an adequate supply of surveillance reporting tools (forms, line list, registers or other means for reporting surveillance data to the district). This must also be done during regular supervisory visits. Include updates about forms and procedures for reporting, investigating and responding to public health events in quarterly district meetings with health facilities and other reporting sites. Ensure you keep and update an inventory of all information to assist you in necessary follow-ups. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 203"
Q49,What types of public health hazards should risk mapping cover?,"Context 1: Risk mapping should extend to all public health hazards as specified by IHR (2005), including chemical, zoonotic, radiological and nuclear. It is important to also include results from the risk mapping. WHO has developed an integrated risk profiling tool for assessment of public health threats, and this can be used within the broader framework of disaster risk management. (Strategic Tool for Assessing Risk Star, WHO, Draft Version, 3.3.1, July 2017), Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 190

Context 3: 5.4 Risk mapping for outbreaks and other public health events	48, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 61"
Q52,What is the purpose of weekly data analysis at facility or district level during an outbreak?,"Context 1: At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 559
Context 2: Weekly reporting provides data for monitoring trends of diseases or conditions to early detect outbreaks. It is important to ensure that the national weekly reporting format is adhered across all health facilities and districts to facilitate comparison within and between the facilities and districts. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 561
Context 3: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 558"
Q54,Who is responsible for data verification at the district level in eIDSR?,"Context 1: It is important in a system whereby eIDSR has been established, to ensure that there are features to improve data quality and these might include:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 901
Context 2: 9.4 Rationale of eIDSR , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 536
Context 3: 9.7 eIDSR development and implementation Process in Malawi , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 585"
Q55,Why is weekly reporting important for monitoring disease trends?,"Context 1: Weekly reporting provides data for monitoring trends of diseases or conditions to early detect outbreaks.

Context 3: Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 569"
Q66,"How can additional diseases or events be categorized for reporting frequency (immediate, weekly, monthly, or quarterly)?","Context 1: Note: Based on risk mapping and diseases burden, decision can be made to categorize any other diseases conditions or events into immediate, weekly or monthly or quarterly report., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 572
Context 2: Immediate reporting of case-based information allows for early detection of unexpected or highly pathogenic/lethal public health events. All the diseases and conditions under immediate reporting should also be reported under aggregated weekly report in the Weekly IDSR Summary Reporting Form., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 488
Context 3: Feedback should also be given periodically of IDSR reportable diseases/conditions, and this can be through weekly, monthly or quarterly epidemiological bulletins. The bulletins provide information on disease patterns and achievement of program objectives in the country. They are usually brief and are important for reaching policy makers, legislators, development partners, program technical staff and stakeholders.

Q72,How are summaries for diseases calculated and recorded in health facilities equipped with computers?,"Context 1: Each week, month, or quarter, a records clerk or statistician or IDSR focal person calculates summaries for all the diseases and records them in a standard form. Events should be aggregated separately from diseases. In case the health facility is equipped with computers, individual patient records should be entered, from which the IDSR priority diseases or conditions subset will be extracted and analysed to get the required weekly, monthly or quarterly compilations., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 579
Context 2: Each month, the health facility should calculate the total number of cases (Suspected and Laboratory Confirmed) and deaths due to priority diseases, conditions and events seen in the health facility. Separate totals are calculated for outpatient cases and inpatient cases. The summary totals are recorded on the Weekly and Monthly IDSR report form (please see Annex 2H) and sent to the district level. The district aggregates the totals from all the health facilities that reported and submit district summary totals to the central level. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 573
Context 3: Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 569"
Q73,"What register is used in isolation units during outbreaks, and why is it important for IDSR summaries?","Context 1: In outbreak scenarios, isolation units that are separate from health facilities can be opened, and they will use a different register to record diseases or events. It is important that this information be captured in the overall IDSR weekly, monthly or quarterly summaries., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 580
Context 2: Depending on each level of laboratory services, laboratory data should be organized in a register so that it can generate monthly summaries. During outbreak, submission of the weekly summaries of the specimens processed, the types of specimens and the results should be done to assist in completion of the variables in the line list register. Efforts should be made to also update the laboratory component of the IDSR data and link epidemiologic/clinical data. Monthly summaries can include the core tests done for which the country has selected as indicator pathogens on the basis of major PHEIC. This is important, as the analysis can produce important trends which can necessitate further investigations. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 576
Context 3: Ensure that health facility personnel know the process for recording and reporting including reporting sites. Also ensure the health facilities record rumours. The registers, which are normally used in Malawi, are the Out-Patient Department (OPD) or In-Patient Department (IPD) registers. IDSR Focal Person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority diseases, conditions or public health events of IDSR from the register.  , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 169"

Q77,"What role does case-based data play in public health events, and how should health staff be prepared?","Context 1: Review with health staff the role that case-based data plays in determining risk factors and the means of disease transmission or exposure to health risks in a public health event. Make sure the staffs have access to a standardized form for reporting case-based information., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 597
Context 2: At each level where data is received (health facility, district or national), the IDSR focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority IDSR diseases/events from the register and enter correctly into aggregated IDSR reporting forms while listing data from all the reporting sites. Troubleshooting and cleaning data prior to analysis is an important data management practice. Disease trends and maps will not be accurate if information about number of cases, time of onset, or geographic location of cases are missing. Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 767

Q95,What is the importance of submitting weekly summaries of processed samples during an outbreak?,"Context 1: Submission of the weekly summaries of the samples processed, and the types of samples as well as the results should be done whenever there is an outbreak, to assist in completion of the variables in the line list register, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 645
Context 2: Depending on each level of laboratory services, laboratory data should be organized in a register so that it can generate monthly summaries. During outbreak, submission of the weekly summaries of the specimens processed, the types of specimens and the results should be done to assist in completion of the variables in the line list register. Efforts should be made to also update the laboratory component of the IDSR data and link epidemiologic/clinical data. Monthly summaries can include the core tests done for which the country has selected as indicator pathogens on the basis of major PHEIC. This is important, as the analysis can produce important trends which can necessitate further investigations. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 576
Context 3: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 558"

Q100,What should be emphasized in the implementation of the One Health approach?,"Context 1: ·   One Health: The One Health approach offers an innovative approach where various disciplines work together to address health at the human-animal-environment interface. In view of the fact that the majority of emerging and re-emerging infections are often zoonosis and responsible for large outbreaks in recent times, maintaining a focus on diseases that affect both humans and animals is a worthwhile investment. MOH is exploring potential technology solutions (i.e. mobile application, EMR automate disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, drone technology, etc.) to reach the One Health surveillance goal. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 582
Context 2: The One Health approach is intrinsic to and strongly reinforced by WHO’s IHR (2005) and the IDSR strategy as well as other global health frameworks. The One Health approach applies toward improving indicator and event-based surveillance, which is cornerstone for the early warning function of the IDSR. Animal and human health workers as well as other relevant partners should be engaged at various levels to be information sources for IDSR to further facilitate information sharing and joint rapid response activities.  The One Health approach offers a comprehensive framework for IHR (2005) implementation, helping to address Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of all sources. The key principles of the One Health approach include prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases (reference to internationally adopted standards i.e. IHR (2005) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) international standards), and support for national public health services and build on the existing structures.  , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 151
Context 3: Ensure implementation of the One Health approach to improve reporting of public health risks across all levels, with emphasis also at the community level.

Ensure that they are also included to strengthen routine reporting and analysis of public health risks and events., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 654
Context 2: Understanding public perceptions, concerns, fears and expectations is as critical for risk communication as understanding the risky practices and behaviours that affect risk.  The understanding of communities must start before and during an emergency. There are many ways to better listen to community concerns and understand their contexts that influence if the advice for corrective or preventive practices given to them will actually be accepted and acted upon. These include Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) surveys or mini-surveys; community walk-throughs, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, getting feedback from stakeholders, social media and media monitoring, etc. A serious attempt must be made to execute health interventions and health advices, based on evidence gathered using these methods and other social science approaches., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1728

Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing. ﷐Respond to alert threshold Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem.  For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.  For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation. ﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management. For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on. ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease.

Context 3: ANNEX 11O: Community alert reporting form	264, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 86"
Q121,How can case definitions be made available when filling in the Community Alert Reporting form?,"Context 1: Step 1 – Identify and record cases, conditions and events: Use of standard case definitions for health service delivery points (human, animal and environment), simplified case definition for community level, in identifying priority diseases, conditions, and identify alerts that can signal emerging public health events. Additionally, case identification can also be done through other health service delivery points (animal and environment) using formal health systems, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning alert and verification system are vital for detecting cases and outbreaks. After identification, all alerts including true events must be recorded in a recognized register including the line list register., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 184
Context 2: ANNEX 11O: Community alert reporting form , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 484
Context 3: Case definitions at the community level are usually simplified and are used to facilitate rapid detection of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 159"
Q125,How should the form be used to capture and report diseases and events at the community level?,"Context 1: At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 173
Context 2: NB: This form should be used to capture and notify/report the priority diseases (Indicator-based surveillance) and events/alerts (event-based surveillance) occurring at the community level.

Q149,How does surveillance data flow from reporting sites to the central level?,"Context 1: The routine flow of surveillance data is usually from reporting sites to the next level up to the central level. A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 750
Context 2: Reporting refers to the process by which surveillance data moves through the surveillance system from the point of generation to the next level. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 161
Context 3: Monitoring whether surveillance reports are received on time and if all reporting sites have reported is an essential first step in the routine analysis of the surveillance system. This assists the district (or other level) surveillance team in identifying silent areas (areas where health events may be occurring but which are not being reported) or reporting sites that need assistance in transmitting their reports. It also depicts how representative the data is for the specific level., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 932"
Q153,What practices should be followed when recording and aggregating data manually or electronically?,"Context 1: Data may be recorded and aggregated either manually or electronically if a computer is available. Regardless of the method, use the following practices:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 769
Context 2: With eIDSR (See Section 9), where EMR or similar digital system is available, this will be updated automatically in the database, while for facilities using paper-based reporting forms; this will be done manually and entered into the OHSP. This aggregation is important to understand the trend of the immediate reportable diseases and plan for effective intervention. For early detection of outbreaks via weekly aggregated reporting, it is recommended to keep the number of variables at a minimum, ideally reporting only number of cases and deaths, to avoid unnecessary burden on the healthcare facilities and maximize reporting efficiency., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 563
Context 3: Follow up the initial verbal report with a written report using a standardized case-based report form. A sample case-based surveillance reporting form for recording case-based information is in Annex 2F at the end of this section. If a computer or other electronic device is available for surveillance or case management, complete and submit the form electronically to the next level. On electronic platforms, ensure you protect the patient privacy by encrypting patient ID data so only few health staff can access the detailed information, or you can also set up appropriate user rights such as creating a password for your use when using a common office computer. In the context of Malawi, this means the reporting can and shall be done electronically using either OHSP or EMRS., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 530"
Q156,How is the routine flow of surveillance data typically organized?,"Context 1: In general, analysing routine surveillance data should address the following questions:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 737
Context 2: The routine flow of surveillance data is usually from reporting sites to the next level up to the central level. A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 750
Context 3: All surveillance activities are coordinated and streamlined. Rather than using scarce resources to maintain multiple surveillance systems with separate vertical activities, resources are combined to collect, manage and analyse information at a single focal point at each level., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 105"
Q159,"How is data collected in areas with an eIDSR system, and how is it accessed at the district level?","Context 1: At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 559
Context 2: At the health facility level, both in-patient and out-patient departments are surveillance sites. The information collected from the site is compiled in standard forms (Weekly and Monthly IDSR Summary Reporting Forms, Case-based Investigation forms, Line listing forms etc.), analysed and then forwarded, to the district health management team. In areas where there is already an eIDSR system, data are entered electronically using a mobile phone or a computer, and the district health management team can access compiled information using a computer (Refer to Section 9 of the 3rd  Edition Malawi IDSR TG on eIDSR on more countries specific examples). In Malawi district team collects the data from the communities and health facilities in its catchment area and merge, aggregate, send and reports to the central level. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 751
Context 3: conducting surveillance. (Note: If a reporting site has the capacity for electronic reporting, there should be an electronic format that is compatible with the methods used at the district, region and national levels. In most countries, where there is eIDSR, DHIS2 has frequently been used as a data system. If electronic reporting is NOT available, ensure that the focal points who are required to manage data have a reliable supply of data collection forms, paper, coloured pencils, graph paper, and log books). , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 358"
Q160,What measures are advised for ensuring data protection and security?,"Context 1: o   Ensuring data security , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 702
Context 2: 2.5	 Data protection and security to protect patients confidentially	87, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 62
Context 3: ·   Data security: Protection of health information is essential in every health information system. Security of data will ensure that information is only accessible by authorized personnel, who need to take action. It also promotes ethical handling of data. Caution should be taken to ensure there are processes for patient privacy. The eIDSR data security and protection protocols of Malawi is following the MOH digital health, HIS policy and relevant government laws to ensure highest standard of protection is implemented. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 583"
Q164,Why is it important to review data carefully after entry?,"Context 1: Once the data have been received and entered into the aggregate forms, review them carefully to ensure no mistakes were made during entry. Since surveillance data informs decisions about disease control and prevention actions, there are important ethical, social and economic consequences if data are not entered and managed correctly or on time., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 777
Context 2: During supervision, stress the importance of data quality and surveillance; that correct data will lead to analysis, interpretation, and the information that will be communicated will lead to action and evaluation. It is recommended that regular data quality audits are conducted at the reporting sites.  (See Annex 2J for checklist on key elements to assess in data quality audits), Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 613
Context 3: Findings from data analysis may trigger investigations and subsequent response to an outbreak, condition, or public health event. Data should be analysed by time, place and person (refer to Table 3.1)., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 780"
Q166,What types of analysis should be conducted on disease data?,"Context 1: ₋          Data analysis is the systematic process of examining data to generate relevant information for timely and appropriate public health action to be taken. Surveillance data should be analysed routinely and the information interpreted for use in public health actions. Capacity for routine data analysis and interpretation should be established and maintained for epidemiological as well as laboratory data , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 167
Context 2: Findings from data analysis may trigger investigations and subsequent response to an outbreak, condition, or public health event. Data should be analysed by time, place and person (refer to Table 3.1)., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 780
Context 3: The principles of data analysis utilized as part of the routine IDSR should be used in crisis affected populations. Analysis on aggregated data is therefore conducted to document and describe disease trends and crossing of thresholds. The data is also used to calculate ratios, rates. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 198"
Q176,What should be included in a histogram showing data from case based forms or line lists?,"Context 1: Prepare a histogram using data from the case reporting forms and line lists. Plot cases on the histogram according to the date of onset. As the histogram is developed, it will demonstrate an epidemic curve.  The title of the graph should include the name of the geographical location been described., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 794
Context 2: Record case information on a line list for later use in summarizing variables for use in time, place and person analysis, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 262
Context 3: For each new case, either in the health facility register or in searches from the community, that fits the surveillance case definition, record the collected information on a line list register, as well as in the case-based reporting form or other recommended form. Where possible, include geo-mapping coordinates. A line list register will keep track of pertinent basic data for cases and potential cases as they are identified (See Annex 4E for a sample line list register). For infectious diseases, list any contacts on the contact listing form and ensure they are monitored daily for the required time for signs and symptoms of the disease (See Annex 4F and 4G), Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 311"
Q178,In what way can histograms be used to draw epidemic curves?,"Context 1: Look at the histogram and observe the shape of the epidemic curve. Draw conclusions about when exposure to the agent that caused the illness occurred, the source of infection and related incubation period., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 336
Context 2: Prepare a histogram using data from the case reporting forms and line lists. Plot cases on the histogram according to the date of onset. As the histogram is developed, it will demonstrate an epidemic curve.

Context 2: Identify the source of infection or cause of the outbreak., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 183
Context 3: During the initial analysis, summarize the outbreak or events and look for clues about where the outbreak or event is occurring, how it is spreading, the source of the outbreak (from a single source, for example (a well or a funeral), and the persons at risk of becoming ill (for example, young children, refugees, person living in rural areas, and so on).  Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 323"
Q187,What factors should be marked on a map during routine analysis of disease surveillance data?,"Context 1: Use manual methods or open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, such as Health Mapper, QGIS, or Geographic Information Software (GIS) to create maps to use as part of routine analysis of disease surveillance of data. On a map of the area where cases occurred, mark the following:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 814
Context 2: Type of analysis﷐Objective﷐Method﷐Data Display Tools﷐Time﷐Detect abrupt or long- term changes in disease or unusual event occurrence, how many occurred, the seasonality and the period of time from exposure to onset of symptoms.﷐Compare the number of case reports received for the current period with the number received in a previous period (days, weeks, months, quarters, seasons or years)﷐Record summary totals in a table or on a line graph or histogram or sequential maps     ﷐Place﷐Identify where cases are occurring (for example, to identify high risk area or locations of populations at risk for the disease)﷐Plot cases on a map and look for clusters or relationships between the location of the cases and the health event being investigated.

Context 3: Roads, water sources, location of specific communities and other factors related to the transmission risk for the disease or condition under investigation. For example, a map for neonatal tetanus includes locations of traditional birth attendants and health facilities where mothers deliver infants. Location of the patients’ residences or most relevant geographical characteristic for this disease or condition (for example, by village, neighbourhood, work camp, or refugee settlement). Another example is when mapping young patients during a meningitis outbreak; remember to locate the school that the patients attend or other locations as appropriate to the disease or condition being investigated. Please see section 11 of this 3rd Edition Malawi TG, for disease specific guidelines for specific recommendations for analysing data by place. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 815"
Q191,"Looking at the guidelines for the analysis of an outbreak, comment on why recording location correctly is important?","Context 1: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 214
Context 2: Monitoring the implementation of the outbreak or event is key for outbreak control. The monitoring results will be important for including in the report of response to supervisory levels, to community leaders and for future advocacy., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 937
Context 3: Investigating outbreaks requires human, logistic and financial resources. When a suspected outbreak or event is reported, promptly verify that the information is accurate and reflects conditions suggesting a true outbreak or event. This will help to ensure that resources are used effectively. To verify the information, consider the following factors:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 201"
Q195,What variables should be compared in the analysis of cases by person?,"Context 1: Analysis by person describes the population with the condition as well as those at risk of contracting the condition or being exposed to factors associated with it. These factors may reveal important clues to understanding the disease, why it occurred and how to control it, thus preventing further spread. Make a distribution of the cases by each of the person variables in the reporting form. For example, compare the total number and proportion of suspected and confirmed cases by:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 821
Context 2: Analysis by person is usually recommended for describing the population at risk. This analysis is easiest when the data are case-based., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 831
Context 3: A simple count of cases does not provide all of the information needed to understand the impact of a disease on the community, health facility or district. Simple percentages and rates are useful for comparing information reported to the district. The first step in analysing person data is to identify the numerator and denominator for calculating percentages and rates., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 833"
Q196,Why is identifying numerators and denominators important in analyzing person data?,"Context 1: Identifying numerators and denominators, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 832
Context 2: After you have selected relevant indicators, specify the numerator and the denominator. For example, if a district objective is for all health facilities to keep trend lines for selected priority diseases, the numerator and denominator are defined as follows: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 142
Context 3: A simple count of cases does not provide all of the information needed to understand the impact of a disease on the community, health facility or district. Simple percentages and rates are useful for comparing information reported to the district. The first step in analysing person data is to identify the numerator and denominator for calculating percentages and rates., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 833"
Q197,How can simple percentages be used in disease surveillance analysis?,"Context 1: A simple count of cases does not provide all of the information needed to understand the impact of a disease on the community, health facility or district. Simple percentages and rates are useful for comparing information reported to the district. The first step in analysing person data is to identify the numerator and denominator for calculating percentages and rates., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 833
Context 2: Simple percentages can be calculated to compare information from populations of different sizes. For example:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 837
Context 3: *The timeliness and completeness are expressed as percentages (%). When the surveillance system is good, the rates for timeliness and completeness should approach 100%. This table allows for monitoring the progress of these two indicators in the district so that action can be taken to improve timeliness for each health facility in the district.￼  , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 428"
Q203,Can one assess health-seeking behavior by analyzing case fatality rate?,"Context 1: A case fatality rate helps to:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 864
Context 2: Public health programs can impact the case fatality rate by ensuring that cases are promptly detected and good quality case management takes place. Some disease control recommendations for specific diseases include reducing the case fatality rate as a target for measuring whether the outbreak response has been effective., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 873
Context 3: To calculate a case fatality rate:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 874"
Q207,How can comparison of incidence numbers across facilities be used?,"Context 1: By calculating the incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of measles cases during the last 12 months in school-aged children. The numerator is the number of new cases that occurred over one year. The denominator is the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The measure obtained is called incidence rate or attack rate.  In this example, the incidence rate is higher in health facility B than in health facility A. The IDSR focal person can compare the impact of the illness on each facility. The facility In-charge/IDSR focal person can also use similar analysis to compare illnesses in different villages., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 841
Context 2: To compare the number of cases of the diseases, conditions or events that occurred in one time or place with the number occurring in another time or place. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 151

Context 2: 3.2.6 Calculate the attack rates	132, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 89
Context 3: In outbreak situation, apart from Case fatality rates, you may also wish to calculate attack rates. See section 3, on how to calculate the Attack rate., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 328"
Q218,How is the epidemic threshold for malaria determined in some countries?,"Context 1: In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week):, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 209
Context 2: The epidemic threshold for malaria in some countries is 3rd Quartile of confirmed malaria cases for the past 5 years; Alert threshold is 2nd quartile/Median of confirmed malaria cases, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 889
Context 3: Background﷐Malaria is an endemic tropical illness with fever following the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito which transmits the parasite. Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, namely: Plasmodium falciparum (the most common), P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Serious malarial infections are usually due to P. falciparum which may result in severe disease. Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in many African countries. In most parts of Africa malaria transmission is highly seasonal. In areas of high transmission in Africa malaria is mainly a disease of children less than 5 years old and pregnant women. However, some countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction of malaria transmission and in such countries malaria has become a disease of all age groups and malaria epidemics are likely to occur. The incubation period from the time of being bitten to onset of symptoms is approximately 10 to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer, with non- P. falciparum species. ﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect malaria cases promptly in areas of high transmission and to detect epidemics promptly in epidemic prone areas or in areas with a large population at risk.﷐Standard case definition: Malaria﷐Uncomplicated malaria: Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is highly variable and mimics that of many other diseases. Although fever is common, it is often intermittent and may even be absent in some cases. The fever is typically irregular initially and commonly associated with chills. Rigors are unusual in acute falciparum malaria. The patient commonly complains of fever, headache, aches and pains elsewhere in the body and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In a young child, there may be irritability, refusal to eat and vomiting. On physical examination, fever may be the only sign. In some patients, the liver and spleen are palpable. This clinical presentation is usually indistinguishable clinically from those of influenza and a variety of other common causes of fever. Unless the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, a patient with falciparum malaria may deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, any person living in an area at risk of malaria with fever or history of fever within the previous 24 hours; without signs of severe malaria, who tests positive for malaria by either rapid diagnostic test or microscopy should be considered a case of uncomplicated malaria (NB WHO presently recommends that all malaria cases should be confirmed by RDT or microscopy). Severe malaria: Severe malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Nearly all deaths from severe malaria result from infections with P. falciparum. Strict definitions of severe malaria have been published for epidemiological and research purposes, but, in practice, there should be a low threshold for starting parenteral treatment in any patient about whom a health care worker is concerned. Even if some of the laboratory measures are not available immediately, this should not delay the start of intensive treatment. A general overview of the features of severe malaria include: impaired consciousness (including unarousable coma); prostration, i.e. generalized weakness so that the patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance; multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24h; deep breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing); acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome; circulatory collapse or shock, systolic blood pressure < 80mm Hg in adults and < 50mm Hg in children; acute kidney injury; clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction; and abnormal bleeding Note: These manifestations can occur singly or, more commonly, in combination in the same patient. Any patient hospitalized with P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia as confirmed by laboratory tests with accompanying symptoms and signs of severe disease (vital organ dysfunction) diagnosed through laboratory.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Malaria﷐If there is an unusual increase in the number of malaria cases or deaths as compared to the same period in previous non-epidemic years: Report suspected epidemic to the next level, Treat with appropriate anti-malarial drugs according to national treatment guidelines Investigate the cause for the increase in cases Make sure cases in children age 2 months up to 5 years are managed according to IMCI guidelines. Conduct community education for prompt detection of cases and access to health facilities.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If the number of cases exceeds the upper limit of cases seen in a previous non-epidemic period in previous years: Evaluate and improve, as needed, prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residential spraying (IRS) for all at risk of malaria. Ensure appropriate case management Ensure adequate supplies and drugs are available in the health facilities﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Graph the number of cases by month/week. Construct an epidemic curve during epidemics. Place: Plot location of households for new cases and deaths. Person: Count the number of new malaria cases and deaths by month and analyse by age group and time of onset.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Malaria﷐Diagnostic test﷐Microscopy: Presence of malarial parasites in blood films for suspected cases Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT): Presence of malarial antigen. ﷐Specimen﷐Blood Usually finger-stick sample for all ages or other accepted method for collecting blood from very young children﷐When to collect﷐For blood smear: prepare blood film for all suspected cases admitted to inpatient facility, or according to national malaria case management guidelines﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Blood smear: Collect blood directly onto correctly cleaned and labelled microscope slides and prepare thick and thin smears. Allow smears to dry thoroughly Stain using the appropriate stain and technique Store stained and thoroughly dried slides at room temperature out of direct sunlight. For rapid diagnostic test: Collect specimen and perform test according to manufacturers’ instructions.﷐Results﷐Thick and thin smear results can be available the same day as preparation. Microscopic examination of malarial slides may also reveal the presence of other blood-borne parasites. RDT result is obtained immediately. Note: In the inpatient setting, perform a hemoglobin estimation laboratory test to confirm severe anaemia, in children 2 months to 5 years in age.﷐Reference﷐Malaria epidemics: Detection and control, forecasting and prevention.

Q221,How does the periodic assessment of surveillance thresholds impact their use?,"Context 1: In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system. This facilitates use of surveillance information for action at the level where it is collected. Periodically, surveillance thresholds are assessed and reset at national or international levels according to the observed trends of the diseases, events or conditions under surveillance., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 890
Context 2: Periodic evaluation to improve the performance of the surveillance system (refer to framework for evaluating surveillance systems)., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 225
Context 3: 1.9.1 The different levels where surveillance activities are performed, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 192"
Q222,Where can one find information on suggested thresholds for taking action in specific diseases or conditions?,"Context 1: A set of definitions for thresholds that trigger some action for responding to specific diseases or conditions, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 232
Context 2: ·             Some data are analysed in the health facility to identify thresholds to take action both for routinely reported priority diseases (disease of public health importance) and case-based diseases (epidemic-prone diseases, and diseases targeted for eradication or elimination). , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 301
Context 3: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 887"
Q224,How are the suggested thresholds in the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines determined?,"Context 1: Thresholds are markers that indicate unusual situation and require that something should happen or change. They help surveillance and program managers answer the question, “When should I take action, and what will that action be?” Information on establishing thresholds is in Section 4.1 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 881
Context 2: It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 54

Context 3: AEFI Investigation﷐An adverse event following immunization (AEFIs) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. Programmes providing immunization services should include a system for AEFI detection and reporting, investigation and management, data analysis, corrective action, relevant communication and evaluation of the system. The ultimate goal of an investigation is to determine whether the vaccine or immunization process is responsible for the reported event (s) or to find another cause and correct it if possible, and reassure the public. Further resources: Definition and application of terms for vaccine pharmacovigilance.

Q333,Why is it important to ask about recent food consumption during a foodborne outbreak investigation?,"Context 1: Decide to investigate a reported outbreak, or public health event , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 188
Context 2: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 178
Context 3: Have any priority diseases or other public health events of concern been detected during the reporting period (this week, for example)? Is an outbreak or unusual public health event suspected?, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 738"
Q335,What is the recommended approach to personal protective equipment (PPE) during the verification and confirmation process?,"Context 1: Annex 4C: Recommended list of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 416
Context 2: Guidance for the Selection and Use of Personal Protective Equipment in Healthcare Settings. https://www.cdc.gov/hai/prevent/ppe.html, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 493
Context 3: The following equipment should be available for the personal protection of all staff investigating a suspected case with highly infectious disease e.g. viral haemorrhagic fever, avian influenza etc. (See reference for the guidelines to use and select PPE at the end of the section). The equipment should be held at national level, if the PPE kits are inadequate, preposition of the PPE should be done in high risk health areas which are likely to report these specific or which have been identified to be at risk through risk assessment. See Annex 5A for other stocks that may be needed to respond to a suspected outbreak., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 417"
Q338,What is the significance of defining a case during an outbreak investigation?,"Context 1: Standard case definition﷐The proposed definition of a reportable event for laboratories is:  “Any situation considered unusual related to received samples (frequency, circumstances of occurrence or clinical description) OR test results (unexpected number of the same species/subspecies, strain type/subtype or antimicrobial resistance pattern, or failure/uncertainty in diagnostics)”.﷐Respond to alert threshold ﷐If a single unexplained death or cluster of deaths or illness is suspected:  Report the suspected case or cases immediately using IDSR alert form  Begin active surveillance  Conduct a case-based investigation.  Notify events that cluster by person, place or time that are of concern.﷐Respond to action threshold ﷐If a case is validated by district/County or Regional or National level will decide which actions to take. They may include the following response measures for routine outbreaks until Public Health Emergency RRT’s may be involved. See Section 6 of these IDSR guidelines.  Infection control measures using standard precautions among cases and with health workers.  Safe and dignified burial  If animals are involved, communicate and coordinated with County Livestock Officer or Ministry of Agriculture official﷐Analyse and interpret data ﷐Time: Track onset of illness or symptoms and time (date) of death.    Place: Plot location of cases by household and community. Investigate the circumstances and possible modes of transmission in each case thoroughly. Examine the possibility of other involved areas. Look for environmental associations. Establish if there is a travel history. Plot cases on a map and look for clusters or relationships between the location of the cases and the health event being investigated    Person: Count cases and track demographic factors. Analyse age distribution, occupational association and recent exposures. Assess risk factors.  ﷐Laboratory confirmation ﷐Diagnosis of public health events of international concern including unexplained death and Clusters of illness are made by their appearance or after considering other more familiar options. There is no specific test that can be done.  , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 295
Context 2: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 158
Context 3: Background﷐In this sub-section, you will find general information about: The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information. Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on. Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness,  General and specific risk factors in African countries. Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team. ﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action. ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event. Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing. ﷐Respond to alert threshold Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem.  For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.  For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation. ﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management. For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on. ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease.

Context 2: Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed: Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak. Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies. Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. Request additional help from other levels as needed. Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings. Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases. Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff. Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements. There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers. Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes. A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan outbreak response interventions accordingly. Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak. Place:Map locations of cases’ households and work sites. If you have a GPS gadget, this will add to understand exact location of the cases; as well as contacts., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 122
Context 3: In outbreak scenarios, isolation units that are separate from health facilities can be opened, and they will use a different register to record diseases or events. It is important that this information be captured in the overall IDSR weekly, monthly or quarterly summaries., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 580"
Q353,Where should the search for contact persons and suspected deaths in the community be conducted?,"Context 1: (ii) Search for contact persons and suspected deaths in the community, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 306

Q356,Compare the methods for communicating during an outbreak with the community and key partners.,"Context 1: It is essential to have in place a communication procedure for communication with the community and key partners. This is important for ensuring the sharing of critical information about identifying and responding to risks associated with the outbreak or event., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 254
Context 2: Communication with affected communities and stakeholders, including the media is essential during outbreak and event response. Thus, establishing routine communication structures and processes between the health and community partners helps to ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. Options for communicating between the various partners can range from press releases, press conferences, television and radio messages, meetings (health personnel, community, religious, opinion and political leaders); Educational and communication materials (posters, fliers); Multi-media presentations (for example, films, video or narrated slide presentations) at the markets, health centres, schools, women’s and other community groups, service organizations, religious centres, local community media, Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.), SMS, telephone, hand-carried message, Community drama groups/play group; site visits; fax, email updates and exchanges of communication materials to more formal decision-making committees.

Q359,Why is it important to record information on a line list register for each new case during an outbreak investigation?,"Context 1: For each new case, either in the health facility register or in searches from the community, that fits the surveillance case definition, record the collected information on a line list register, as well as in the case-based reporting form or other recommended form. Where possible, include geo-mapping coordinates. A line list register will keep track of pertinent basic data for cases and potential cases as they are identified (See Annex 4E for a sample line list register). For infectious diseases, list any contacts on the contact listing form and ensure they are monitored daily for the required time for signs and symptoms of the disease (See Annex 4F and 4G), Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 311
Context 2: During an outbreak, ensure data are collected using a line list., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 778
Context 3: During an outbreak, the line list must be established and used as a primary data collection tool. The columns under the IDSR Line List should be changed based on the situation. The information from each reported case should be added to a single row in the spreadsheet. This paper form should be routinely incorporated in the IDSR Routinely Reported Database to facilitate comprehensive analysis and reporting to next level daily as well as on weekly basis., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 475"
Q360,"What information should be recorded on a ""case based surveillance reporting form"" for each new case during an outbreak investigation?","Context 1: Record information of all cases on a “case based surveillance reporting form” (See sample Annex 2F). At least record the following:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 312
Context 2: Record information about the suspected cases. This information will be used during case investigation activities., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 440
Context 3: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 214"

Q370,Contrast the information recorded in the line list register and the sample line list register (Annex 4E) during an outbreak investigation.,"Context 1: For each new case, either in the health facility register or in searches from the community, that fits the surveillance case definition, record the collected information on a line list register, as well as in the case-based reporting form or other recommended form. Where possible, include geo-mapping coordinates. A line list register will keep track of pertinent basic data for cases and potential cases as they are identified (See Annex 4E for a sample line list register). For infectious diseases, list any contacts on the contact listing form and ensure they are monitored daily for the required time for signs and symptoms of the disease (See Annex 4F and 4G), Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 311
Context 2: For all events, establish a line listing of suspected cases or events or conditions reported as part of initial and ongoing investigation and ensure it is always updated, while at the same time maintaining the link with appropriate sectors, depending on a particular disease or event. The line list should be kept where there is a suspected outbreak and where an isolation unit has been opened, but if several isolation units have been opened, the district should maintain a combined line list. Refer to Annex 4E for a sample line list.  , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 535
Context 3: A sample form for tracking reports of outbreaks and rumours is in Annex 4A of this section. If the district is using a district analysis workbook for recording and analysing long-term trends, the district should include the tracking form in the District Log book of alerts and rumours, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 215"
Q373,What is the purpose of calculating case fatality rates during an outbreak situation?,"Context 1: In outbreak situation, apart from Case fatality rates, you may also wish to calculate attack rates. See section 3, on how to calculate the Attack rate., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 328
Context 2: To calculate a case fatality rate:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 874
Context 3: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 558"
Q374,How can the shape of an epidemic curve offer insights into the outbreak?,"Context 1: Below are some of the examples of the shapes of epidemic curves and possible interpretation:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 340

Q378,"When conducting analytic studies, what are some possible study designs to test hypotheses about the outbreak causes?","Context 1: Review the analysis results while identifying potential risk factors for an outbreak. For example:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 330
Context 2: To generate and test the hypotheses of the outbreaks, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1986
Context 3: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 259"

Q383,"Contrast the purposes of time, place, and person analyses during an outbreak investigation.","Context 1: To characterize the outbreak in terms of time, place and persons, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1984
Context 2: During the initial analysis, summarize the outbreak or events and look for clues about where the outbreak or event is occurring, how it is spreading, the source of the outbreak (from a single source, for example (a well or a funeral), and the persons at risk of becoming ill (for example, young children, refugees, person living in rural areas, and so on).  Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 323
Context 3: Findings from data analysis may trigger investigations and subsequent response to an outbreak, condition, or public health event. Data should be analysed by time, place and person (refer to Table 3.1)., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 780"
Q385,"Why is it important to compare age groups in outbreak investigations, and how can this information be used for interventions?","Context 1: Use disease-specific information to decide which variables to compare. For example, if information has been collected about cholera outbreak, specify the age groupings that are targeted by PHIM. Compare the age groupings of cases detected in young children (age 5 to 14 years) and cases in adults (age 15 and over)., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 830
Context 2: Information developed from the person analysis is essential for planning the outbreak response because it describes more precisely the high-risk group(s) for transmission of this disease or condition. For example, if yellow fever cases occurred in patients less than 15 years of age, then the immunization response might need to target children less than 15 years of age., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 349
Context 3: From the observations gathered during the descriptive process, a hypothesis can be generated about the causes of observed patterns and the factors that increase risk for given outbreak. E.g. in Table 4.1 above, one might hypothesize that the older you are, the more likely you fell ill and one might want to determine if age is associated with illness., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 356"
Q386,"In outbreak investigations, which study designs, such as case-control studies or cohort studies, are suitable for testing hypotheses, and why?","Context 1: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 259
Context 2: Review the analysis results while identifying potential risk factors for an outbreak. For example:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 330
Context 3: Epidemiological study designs., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 496"
Q390,Why is refining hypotheses based on analytic study results important in outbreak investigations?,"Context 1: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 259
Context 2: Using descriptive analysis generate hypothesis of outbreak , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 357
Context 3: To test a hypothesis, one must use an analytic epidemiology process to answer questions of how and why the population was affected, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 358"
Q391,"Why is it important to disseminate all reports, including preliminary and interim, even if no conclusive risk factors have been identified for a given outbreak?","Context 1: All reports (Preliminary, Interim and final) should always be disseminated, even if no conclusive risk factors have been identified for a given outbreak. Prepare also situation reports (SitReps) of the given outbreak and share with relevant stakeholders. Section 7, describes various channels of communication during outbreak., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 365
Context 2: If risk factors are already known, formulate conclusions and recommendations about the outbreak:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 366
Context 3: Recommendations: For controlling the situation further investigation/studies may be recommended. The district rapid response team should then immediately prepare an outbreak investigation report. This detailed report of the outbreak investigation should be prepared and disseminated immediately to the health facility where the outbreak occurred, district, national and also WHO. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 371"
Q402,Contrast the objectives of a situation report (SitRep) with those of a detailed outbreak investigation report. How do they differ in their focus and audience? ,"Context 1: In many countries, the national level or region/province publishes a national public health bulletin, but during outbreak, these reports will be produced more regularly and describe the outbreak including the trend i.e. situation reports (Sitrep). These situation reports or bulletins have a wider audience than just the health staff in a particular district or health facility. They are usually brief (2 to 8 pages). They are seen by policy makers, legislators and other decision-makers. They are valuable channels for reaching technical and donor partners., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1829
Context 2: All reports (Preliminary, Interim and final) should always be disseminated, even if no conclusive risk factors have been identified for a given outbreak.

Q403,"Compare the use of a transmission tree and a spot map in outbreak investigations. How do they contribute to understanding disease spread, and what distinct information do they provide?","Context 1: To understand the spread of the disease you should draw a transmission tree starting with the index case. Moreover, the transmission tree assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings to the spread of the disease in the given geographical area and hence regulates the infection transmission and the control measures. Reconstruction of a transmission chain or tree can be done provided the information is obtained from line list, and also a review of the timeline of dates of illness or contact with other cases, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment. The transmission tree is important as it assists in documenting the routes of transmission in a given geographical area and hence enables planned interventions. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 373
Context 2: Analyse and interpret data: Influenza caused by a new subtype ﷐  1-Manage the data use a line list and  establish procedures for record-keeping and data validation    2-Analyse the data Time:Construct an epidemic curve, with the weekly number of cases on the y-axis, and their date or time of illness onset on the x-axis. Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc.  These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.  Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event.  The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used: • Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.) • Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.). Person:  To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse:  • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases;  • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and  • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.  Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 191
Context 3: Analysing data by place provides insight about where a disease is occurring. Establishing and regularly updating a spot map of cases for selected diseases can give ideas as to where, how, and why the disease is spreading. The dot density will give the total number of cases per defined geographic area., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 809"
Q406,"Which channels of communication are recommended in Section 7 for reporting outbreak findings, and why are these channels important?","Context 1: It is essential to have in place a communication procedure for communication with the community and key partners.

Q412,Why should control measures be implemented concurrently with other investigation steps in an outbreak?,"Context 1: Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps. Often, non-specific control measures can be put into place regardless of the type of disease or source. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 378
Context 2: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 259
Context 3: Once an outbreak is identified, control measures are important for interrupting disease transmission and or limiting exposure to the source of infection and preventing occurrence of future outbreaks. If a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified, control measures should target specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines gives a description of some of the control measures for each priority diseases and references for further reading., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 376"
Q416,What is the significance of implementing control measures at the first available point in the investigation process?,"Context 1: Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps. Often, non-specific control measures can be put into place regardless of the type of disease or source. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 378
Context 2: The single most important measure of timeliness is whether data are submitted in time to begin investigations and implement control measures. Timeliness of reporting should be measured against standards developed by each country in accordance with the timelines set by WHO AFRO. Important aspects of timelines of reporting in a communicable disease surveillance system include: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 214
Context 3: Monitoring the implementation of the outbreak or event is key for outbreak control. The monitoring results will be important for including in the report of response to supervisory levels, to community leaders and for future advocacy., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 937"
Q418,How do non-specific control measures differ from specific control measures in outbreak settings?,"Context 1: Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps.

Q472,What kind of responsibilities lie at the national level compared to district or facility levels during an outbreak?,"Context 1: The districts have the overall responsibility for investigating outbreaks and public health events. The national level provides technical support and policy guidance. This guideline also applies to health facility level., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 189
Context 2: The national level should compile the surveillance data received from all the districts. It national level should look for epidemics that were not identified by the districts. Follow up with areas where reporting continues to be unreliable or does not happen at all. Support the districts in providing assistance to the health facilities when they evaluate the measurements and take action to improve the situation. Provide feedback to each of the levels (national, district, health facility and community). , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 363
Context 3: The district level is the hub and focus for integrating surveillance functions. The district is the first level in the local health system, which has dedicated staff in all aspects of public health such as planning as well as supporting implementation of Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), monitoring health events in the health facility, and in the community, mobilizing community action, asking for national assistance to protect the district’s health.

Context 2: The first case was a 25-year old university student with onset of symptoms on 21 March 2012. He was admitted to Neno District hospital on 4 April 2012 after a week of coughing, fever, and shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and pericarditis, and he was soon transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU). As his condition worsened, he was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital for further treatment; he was intubated in ICU the next day and died on 25 April 2012.

Q510,"Reflecting on the information provided, explain how the interactions between the first case and healthcare workers might influence the development and spread of a respiratory illness.","Context 1: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system.  By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade? The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including:  routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease  a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community  a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities  Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues.  A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following:  Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting.  A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour.  The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents.  Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following:  Provide clear information to frontline staff about  Why report unusual events?  What events are reportable?  How to report an unusual event?  What happens after you report?  Examples of event reporting: Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting.  More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well.  Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting  All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.   How reported information is handled:  The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO. This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally.  In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal.  Detect cases.  Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 293
Context 2: Exchange information on risk monitoring. It should be emphasized that other relevant health sectors can equally benefit from information provided by the human health sector and vice versa. In some events, human cases can be the first indication of a threat to other sectors. For example, animal health services will be impacted by cases of Crimean- Congo haemorrhagic fever, as cases in humans constitute the primary indicator for viral circulation in animals as infection is asymptomatic in livestock, as such intervention must be done at this sector. For instance, vaccination among livestock might be crucial if detection of human cases of anthrax or rift valley fever have initially occurred as signal for asymptomatic diseases among animals. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 584

Q523,Does the TG contain case definitions for Dengue Fever?,"Context 1:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss. The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania. Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.  Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition ﷐Acute clinical case Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND  Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance) Atypical case Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others. Severe acute case Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization Suspected and confirmed chronic cases Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.   Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test     a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age        group).   b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the next level Collect specimens for confirming the cases Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmed Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy. Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. To avoid mosquito bites: Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs Use mosquito repellents Use mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoes Mosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

Context 2: Background﷐﷐Dengue fever is an arbovirus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus). Dengue is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family. Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominately in urban and semi-urban areas. During dengue epidemics, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often 40% to 50%, but can reach 80% to 90%. Dengue fever is a severe, influenza-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Epidemic dengue activity in Africa has mostly been classical dengue fever caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2 without associated mortality. The first major outbreak of DENV-3 in Africa was documented in Mozambique in 1984-1985. During this outbreak, most patients experienced secondary infections and 2 deaths were attributed to DHF and shock. In 2008, yellow fever and DENV-3 were found to be co-circulating in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, however, no severe dengue cases or deaths attributable to dengue were identified. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever. Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle. The virus circulates in the blood of infected human for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that they have a fever. A sylvatic transmission cycle has been documented in west Africa where DENV-2 has been found in monkeys. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission. At present, the only method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes using environmental management and chemical methods. ﷐﷐Surveillance goal﷐Surveillance for suspected cases and investigation of clusters of suspected cases in areas with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus mosquitoes﷐ Standard case definition: Dengue Fever﷐Dengue Fever Suspected case: Any person with acute febrile illness of 2-7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia. Dengue Fever Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titres, positive PCR or viral isolation). Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever: A probable or confirmed case of dengue with bleeding tendencies as evidenced by one or more of the following: positive tourniquet test; petechieae, ecchymoses or purpura; bleeding: mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other; haematemesis or melaena; and thrombocytopenia (100 000 cells or less per mm3) and evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex, 20% drop in haematocrit following volume replacement therapy compared to baseline, signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, hypo-proteinaemia).

Context 3: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread. Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year. Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens. The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly.

These symptoms could or could not be associated to a loss of conscience. It can appear at any age. Epilepsy is the most common result of brain cells disturbance that lead to excessive nerve-cell discharges. According to the disturbance on some or many groups of cells, seizures could be partial or generalized. Seizures with tonic-clonic muscle movements are named convulsion or fit or attack. Convulsion can appear at any age; all convulsions are not systematically epilepsy. Epilepsy is frequent in the Region and its prevalence rate range from 2.2 to 58 per 1000 persons. Studies from five sub-Saharan African countries showed an incidence ranging from 64 to 156 per 100,000 person/year. This higher incidence may be a consequence of many risk factors which are related with predisposing factors such as poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity. Many etiological factors are related with communicable diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticerocisis and HIV), non-communicable diseases (high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism and illicit drug use), poorer medical facilities, poorer general health and a lower standard of living. Misunderstanding linked to cultural beliefs, sigma and exclusion do not facilitate appropriate care. Epilepsy substantially increases mortality risk, particularly in conditions of later detection due to lack of well-trained health workers to diagnose and treat neurological disorders. Death and injury occur primarily due to status epilepticus (especially in the case of abrupt medication withdrawal), burns and drowning.  It has been estimated that in developing countries, up to 80% of people with epilepsy are not receiving treatment, or are often not even identified. While the etiological diagnosis of the epilepsies may be more difficult in developing countries, due to limited investigative resources, many can be diagnosed on the basis of simple clinical and epidemiological knowledge.﷐, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 182

Q538,Does the TG contain case definitions for Malaria?,"Context 1: Background﷐Malaria is an endemic tropical illness with fever following the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito which transmits the parasite. Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, namely: Plasmodium falciparum (the most common), P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Serious malarial infections are usually due to P. falciparum which may result in severe disease. Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in many African countries. In most parts of Africa malaria transmission is highly seasonal. In areas of high transmission in Africa malaria is mainly a disease of children less than 5 years old and pregnant women. However, some countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction of malaria transmission and in such countries malaria has become a disease of all age groups and malaria epidemics are likely to occur. The incubation period from the time of being bitten to onset of symptoms is approximately 10 to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer, with non- P. falciparum species. ﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect malaria cases promptly in areas of high transmission and to detect epidemics promptly in epidemic prone areas or in areas with a large population at risk.﷐Standard case definition: Malaria﷐Uncomplicated malaria: Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is highly variable and mimics that of many other diseases. Although fever is common, it is often intermittent and may even be absent in some cases. The fever is typically irregular initially and commonly associated with chills. Rigors are unusual in acute falciparum malaria. The patient commonly complains of fever, headache, aches and pains elsewhere in the body and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In a young child, there may be irritability, refusal to eat and vomiting. On physical examination, fever may be the only sign. In some patients, the liver and spleen are palpable. This clinical presentation is usually indistinguishable clinically from those of influenza and a variety of other common causes of fever. Unless the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, a patient with falciparum malaria may deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, any person living in an area at risk of malaria with fever or history of fever within the previous 24 hours; without signs of severe malaria, who tests positive for malaria by either rapid diagnostic test or microscopy should be considered a case of uncomplicated malaria (NB WHO presently recommends that all malaria cases should be confirmed by RDT or microscopy). Severe malaria: Severe malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Nearly all deaths from severe malaria result from infections with P. falciparum. Strict definitions of severe malaria have been published for epidemiological and research purposes, but, in practice, there should be a low threshold for starting parenteral treatment in any patient about whom a health care worker is concerned. Even if some of the laboratory measures are not available immediately, this should not delay the start of intensive treatment. A general overview of the features of severe malaria include: impaired consciousness (including unarousable coma); prostration, i.e. generalized weakness so that the patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance; multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24h; deep breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing); acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome; circulatory collapse or shock, systolic blood pressure < 80mm Hg in adults and < 50mm Hg in children; acute kidney injury; clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction; and abnormal bleeding Note: These manifestations can occur singly or, more commonly, in combination in the same patient. Any patient hospitalized with P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia as confirmed by laboratory tests with accompanying symptoms and signs of severe disease (vital organ dysfunction) diagnosed through laboratory.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Malaria﷐If there is an unusual increase in the number of malaria cases or deaths as compared to the same period in previous non-epidemic years: Report suspected epidemic to the next level, Treat with appropriate anti-malarial drugs according to national treatment guidelines Investigate the cause for the increase in cases Make sure cases in children age 2 months up to 5 years are managed according to IMCI guidelines. Conduct community education for prompt detection of cases and access to health facilities.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If the number of cases exceeds the upper limit of cases seen in a previous non-epidemic period in previous years: Evaluate and improve, as needed, prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residential spraying (IRS) for all at risk of malaria.

Construct an epidemic curve during epidemics. Place: Plot location of households for new cases and deaths. Person: Count the number of new malaria cases and deaths by month and analyse by age group and time of onset.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Malaria﷐Diagnostic test﷐Microscopy: Presence of malarial parasites in blood films for suspected cases Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT): Presence of malarial antigen. ﷐Specimen﷐Blood Usually finger-stick sample for all ages or other accepted method for collecting blood from very young children﷐When to collect﷐For blood smear: prepare blood film for all suspected cases admitted to inpatient facility, or according to national malaria case management guidelines﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Blood smear: Collect blood directly onto correctly cleaned and labelled microscope slides and prepare thick and thin smears. Allow smears to dry thoroughly Stain using the appropriate stain and technique Store stained and thoroughly dried slides at room temperature out of direct sunlight. For rapid diagnostic test: Collect specimen and perform test according to manufacturers’ instructions.﷐Results﷐Thick and thin smear results can be available the same day as preparation. Microscopic examination of malarial slides may also reveal the presence of other blood-borne parasites. RDT result is obtained immediately.

Q555,Does the TG contain case definitions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)?,"Context 1: Background﷐Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a global threat in 2003 when international spread resulted in 8,098 SARS cases in 26 countries, with 774 deaths. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was a striking feature of the SARS outbreak. The majority of the cases were adults. The case fatality ratio of SARS is estimated to range from 0% to more than 50% depending on the age group affected and reporting centre, with a crude global CFR of approximately 9.6%. The mean incubation period is 5 days, with the range of 2-10 days. Patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms including fever, malaise, myalgia, headache and rigors. Cough (initially dry), dyspnoea and diarrhoea may be present in the first week but more commonly reported in the second week of illness. Severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress. Up to 70% of the patients develop diarrhoea. Disease transmission occurs mainly during the second week of illness. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes SARS is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans recently. In the inter-epidemic period, all countries must remain vigilant for the recurrence of SARS and maintain their ability to detect and respond to the possible re-emergence of SARS Immediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR ( Annex 2, IHR ).﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection and investigation of individuals with clinically apparent SARS-CoV.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case of SARS is an individual with: A history of fever, or documented fever ≥ 38 °C AND One or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath) AND Radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or ARDS or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause AND No alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness. Confirmed case of SARS: An individual who tests positive for SARS-CoV infection by the WHO recommended testing procedures.﷐Respond to suspected case﷐Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels. Practice infection control precautions for an acute respiratory disease with epidemic/pandemic potential immediately and enhance Standard Precautions throughout the health care setting. Treat and manage the patient according to national guidelines. Collect and transport laboratory specimens from case-patient and from symptomatic contacts and arrange for laboratory testing. Review clinical history and exposure history during 2-10 days before disease onset. Identify and follow-up close contacts of case-patient. Conduct active searches for additional cases. Expedite the diagnosis.(WHO will assist in the investigation of SARS alerts as appropriate, including facilitating access to laboratory services)﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Response to SARS alert is same as response to suspected case (see above). SARS ALERT: An individual with clinical evidence of SARS AND with an epidemiological risk factor for SARS-CoV infection in the 10 days before the onset of symptoms OR Two or more health-care workers with clinical evidence of SARS in the same health-care unit and with onset of illness in the same 10-day period OR Three or more persons (health-care workers and/or patients and/or visitors) with clinical evidence of SARS with onset of illness in the same 10-day period and epidemiologically linked to a health-care facility.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly/monthly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak. Place:Plot locations of case households and work sites using precise mapping. Person: Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. During the outbreak, count and report cases and deaths. Analyze age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors immediately.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)﷐Diagnostic test﷐Confirmed positive PCR for SARS virus: (Note: Testing meets the requirements for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS and almost always involves two or more different tests or the same assay on two or more occasions during the course of the illness or from different clinical sites) At least 2 different clinical specimens (eg nasopharyngeal and stool) OR The same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more days during the course of the illness (e.g. 2 or more nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR 2 different assays or repeat PCR using the original clinical sample on each occasion of testing Seroconversion by ELISA or IFA: Negative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on convalescent serum OR Four-fold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent phase sera tested in parallel. Virus isolation: Isolation in cell culture of SARS-Cov from any specimen; plus PCR confirmation using a validated method﷐Specimen﷐Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate specimen of choice for respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs or oropharyngeal swabs Stool Serum﷐When to collect﷐The respiratory tract specimen can be collected at any time, but are best taken during the acute phase of illness. The time collection of paired blood samples is very important: Collect an acute illness sample at first contact withthe patient at days 7, 14, 28 and 90 after onset where possible. Collect blood on discharge if collection of a convalescent sample is unlikely.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐SARS specimens should be handled according to appropriate biosafety practices in order to avoid laboratory-related infections and spread of disease to close contacts. Clinical samples from patients should be collected by trained personnel. Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate: have the patient sit with the head titled slightly backward. Instil 1.5 ml non-bacteriostatic sterile saline (Ph 7.0) into one nostril. Flush a plastic catheter or tubing (e.g. mucus trap tubing) with 2-3 ml of saline. Insert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate. Aspirate nasopharyngeal secretions. Repeat for the other nostril. Collect aspirates in sterile vial or mucus trap. Remove tubings and discard in plastic bag. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs: use only sterile Dacron or rayon swab with plastic shafts. Place each swab immediately in a tube containing Virus Transport Media (VTM). Serum collection: Collect 5-10 ml of whole blood in a serum separator tube. Allow blood to clot Respiratory / stool / blood/serum specimens: Refrigerate immediately (4°C). If transport/ shipping will be international or will occur > 5 days after collection of last specimen, freeze the specimens at – 20 °C (serum), -20/-70 °C (respiratory specimens) for planned shipping with dry ice if available.

Context 3: Background﷐Infection of the lower airways caused by bacteria or viruses transmitted person-to-person via aerosolized respiratory droplet spread. The main bacterial causes of pneumonia among children are Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and pneumonia represent the number one cause of mortality among children less than 5 years of age. Incubation period is usually less than 7 days, depending on the aetiology. WHO and UNICEF recommend use of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to childhood pneumonia. Early antimicrobial therapy has been shown to reduce mortality. Resistance of the pneumococcus and Hib to beta-lactams (for example, ampicillin), sulfonamides (for example, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and other antimicrobials is increasing. Viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may also cause ARI and pneumonia.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early identification of pneumonia cases and epidemics using clinical definitions. Monitor antimicrobial resistance routinely and during outbreaks. Reducing the proportion of severe pneumonia cases compared to non-severe pneumonia cases to monitor quality of interventions.﷐Standard case definition﷐Clinical case definition (IMCI) for pneumonia: A child presenting with cough or difficult breathing and: 50 or more breaths per minute for infant age 2 months up to 1 year 40 or more breaths per minute for young child 1 year up to 5 years. (Note: A young infant age 0 up to 2 months with cough and fast breathing is classified in IMCI as “serious bacterial infection” and is referred for further evaluation.) Clinical case definition (IMCI) for severe pneumonia: A child presenting with cough or difficult breathing and any general danger sign, or chest in drawing or stridor in a calm child. General danger signs for children 2 months to 5 years are: unable to drink or breast feed, vomits everything, convulsions, lethargy, or unconsciousness. Confirmed case: Radiographic or laboratory confirmation of pneumonia will not be feasible in most districts., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 273"

Context 2: Most countries have used an assessment tool developed by WHO/AFRO to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response systems and to identify where improvements are needed. Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. The assessment provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. The national strategic plan could also be used as reference while preparing a district specific action plan. For other countries, who have undergone JEE, the NAPHS (National Action Plan for Health Security) can also be used., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 311

Context 2: Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 118
Context 3: Background﷐Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics. All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).  ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases. Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaited Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation. Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 119"
Q652,What is the goal of surveillance for acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome?,"Context 1: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98
Context 2: During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 116
Context 3: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 83"
Q657,What specimens are used for diagnostic tests in acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome?,"Context 1: Laboratory confirmation: Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome﷐Diagnostic test﷐Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Ebola/Marburg, CCHF, Lassa or West Nile Fever ﷐Specimen﷐For ELISA: Whole blood, serum or plasma  For RT-PCR: Whole blood or blood clot, serum/plasma or tissue For immunohisto-chemistry: Skin or tissue specimens from fatal cases NB: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)o theoretically can be performed in any health care setting and without additional equipment, however, use of an RDT may result in both false positive and false negative test results.

Q661,What actions should be taken once a case is confirmed during an outbreak?,"Context 1: Before an outbreak, the following should take place:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1758
Context 2: Respond to action threshold: Monkeypox﷐If a single case is confirmed: Maintain strict infection control measures practices throughout the duration of the outbreak. Mobilize the community for early detection and care. Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to implement infection control in the home care setting and during funerals. Conduct active searches for additional cases. Request additional help from national and international levels.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly/monthly. Construct an epidemic curve. Place:Map location of case households. Person:Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. During the outbreak, count and report cases (including suspected and confirmed) and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors (contact with wild animals or another active confirmed case) immediately., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 232
Context 3: Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 187"
Q667,Where should suspected cases be isolated during an outbreak?,"Context 1: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 158
Context 2: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 190
Context 3: Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed: Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak. Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies. Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. Request additional help from other levels as needed. Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings. Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases. Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff. Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements. There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers. Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes. A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan outbreak response interventions accordingly. Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak. Place:Map locations of cases’ households and work sites. If you have a GPS gadget, this will add to understand exact location of the cases; as well as contacts., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 122"

Q673,Why is it important to analyze age and sex distribution during an outbreak of acute haemorrhagic fever?,"Context 1: After taking the above factors into consideration, the situation may require a more urgent response than might otherwise have occurred. For example, reports of a suspected viral haemorrhagic fever case are treated with more urgency than reports of a less virulent disease because of the potential for high rates of death and rapid transmission., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 211

Context 3: Information developed from the person analysis is essential for planning the outbreak response because it describes more precisely the high-risk group(s) for transmission of this disease or condition.

Context 3: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis E Enterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem. Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers. In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease. Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water. Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C: Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus. Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon.  Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year.  Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person.  Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention. To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020 There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 125"
Q681,What is the goal of surveillance for acute viral hepatitis?,"Context 1: The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 101
Context 2: During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 116
Context 3: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98"
Q685,How is chronic viral hepatitis C actively confirmed after a positive screening test?,"Context 1: Laboratory Test for Chronic Viral Hepatitis﷐Chronic Viral Hepatitis B (HBV) Basic initial laboratory investigations: The following laboratory tests should be requested after thorough history and physical examination in HBsAg positive individuals; Establish chronicity: Persistence of HBsAg for over 6 months after acute infection or presence of chronic liver disease/tumour. Establish HBe antigen (Ag)/Antibody (Ab) status: HBe Ag and Ab Establish inflammatory activity: liver function tests Determine the level of viraemia – viral load: HBV DNA Screen for the presence of chronic liver disease or other complications using clinical examination for stigmata of chronic liver disease, abdominal ultrasound, coagulation profile, full blood count Screen for other co-infections: HCV Ab, HIV, HDV (in endemic regions)   Supportive investigation: determine blood urea and creatinine Consider liver biopsy or fibro-scan if indicated  Chronic Viral Hepatitis C (HCV)  Initial Investigations for HCV Patients: The screening test for HCV is a HCV Ab test. Unlike HBV testing, a positive HCV screening test (anti-HCV Ab) does not equate to active infection.  Also, the HCV testing often provides several false positive results.  The following steps are recommended to establish active infection; Confirm HCV Ab testing using ELISA Confirm active infection using RNA testing; detectable HCV RNA confirms active infection; if RNA is undetectable, no further testing is indicated. It indicates past infection or false-positive serological test Further testing for RNA positive cases include liver function test (LFT), abdominal ultrasound, viral genotyping, full blood count (FBC), blood urea and electrolytes (BUE) and creatinine  Screen for co-infections - HIV, HBV Assess degree of inflammation and fibrosis by conducting the following test: Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) score (the score uses a combination of age, platelet count, AST, ALT tests to derive the score) Fibroscan Liver biopsy is the gold standard., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 129

Context 2: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis E Enterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem. Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers. In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease. Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water. Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C: Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus. Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon.  Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year.  Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person.  Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention. To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020 There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 125

Unlike HBV testing, a positive HCV screening test (anti-HCV Ab) does not equate to active infection.  Also, the HCV testing often provides several false positive results.  The following steps are recommended to establish active infection; Confirm HCV Ab testing using ELISA Confirm active infection using RNA testing; detectable HCV RNA confirms active infection; if RNA is undetectable, no further testing is indicated. It indicates past infection or false-positive serological test Further testing for RNA positive cases include liver function test (LFT), abdominal ultrasound, viral genotyping, full blood count (FBC), blood urea and electrolytes (BUE) and creatinine  Screen for co-infections - HIV, HBV Assess degree of inflammation and fibrosis by conducting the following test: Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) score (the score uses a combination of age, platelet count, AST, ALT tests to derive the score) Fibroscan Liver biopsy is the gold standard., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 129

Q710,Compare the goals of AEFI surveillance and the standard case definition for AEFI.,"Context 1: Background﷐AEFI surveillance serves as a quality assurance mechanism for national immunization programmes and, in most countries needs continuous strengthening. There are five possible causes of AEFI: 1/ a true product reaction; 2/ a product defect; 3/ an immunization error; 4/ immunization stress-related response; and 5/ a coincidental health event.

Context 2: AEFI Investigation﷐An adverse event following immunization (AEFIs) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. Programmes providing immunization services should include a system for AEFI detection and reporting, investigation and management, data analysis, corrective action, relevant communication and evaluation of the system. The ultimate goal of an investigation is to determine whether the vaccine or immunization process is responsible for the reported event (s) or to find another cause and correct it if possible, and reassure the public. Further resources: Definition and application of terms for vaccine pharmacovigilance.

Q713,What is Anthrax and what causes it?,"Context 1: Anthrax is an acute illness caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram positive, encapsulated, spore forming and none motile bacteria. The disease commonly affects wild and domestic herbivores, human and carnivores are incidental hosts. Three occurrence forms of the disease in human include cutaneous, inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. The transmission of the disease can be through intestine (ingestion), Respiratory (inhalation) and skin (cutaneous) from infected animal tissues and from infected person., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1978
Context 2: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products. The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown. Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products. The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed. There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation. In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks. To monitor control and prevention programmes, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 135

Q731,Contrast the impact of the MenAfriVac vaccine on Nm A epidemics with the occurrence of epidemics from other serogroups.,"Context 1: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children. Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round.  Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics. Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X. Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people. Incubation period is 2 to 10 days. Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa. During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended The current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks. To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures. To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures. To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts. To monitor antibiotic susceptibility., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 143

Neisseria meningitidis is a fastidious organism, is expensive and difficult. It requires excellent techniques for specimen collection and handling and expensive media and antisera. Initial specimens in an outbreak or for singly occurring isolates of N. meningitis or Neisseria meningitidis should be serogrouped and an antibiogram performed to ensure appropriate treatment. Trans isolate medium (TI) is stable. If properly stored at temperature (4ºC) it can be kept for up to two years after preparation. In the refrigerator, the liquid phase turns gelatinous but reliquifies at room temperature. Unused TI bottles should be kept tightly sealed. If there is any colour change (yellowing or clouding of the liquid medium) or drying or shrinkage of the agar slant, the medium should not be used.﷐Reference: Bacterial Meningitis﷐Managing meningitis epidemics in Africa: A quick reference guide for health authorities and health-care workers Revised 2015, WHO/HSE/GAR/ERI/2010.4.

Context 2: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread. Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year. Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens. The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly. Laboratory confirmation can confirm specific pathogenic agent outbreak, but laboratory confirmation is not necessary for routine surveillance of diarrhoea with dehydration. Monitor antimicrobial resistance during outbreaks of bacterial origin.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in the past 24 hours with or without dehydration and: Some dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: restlessness, irritability; sunken eyes; thirsty; skin pinch goes back slowly, or Severe dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: lethargy or unconsciousness; sunken eyes; not able to drink or drinking poorly; skin pinch goes back very slowly. Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed with stool culture for a known enteric pathogen.

Context 3: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.    Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.    The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths.   One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.            ﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by:  Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them; Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths  , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 245"
Q741,Contrast the impact of the MenAfriVac vaccine on Nm A epidemics with the impact on other serogroups in recent years.,"Context 1: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children. Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round.  Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics. Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X. Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people. Incubation period is 2 to 10 days. Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa. During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended The current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks. To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures. To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures. To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts. To monitor antibiotic susceptibility., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 143

Context 3: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 887"
Q763,What is the standard case definition for Chikungunya?,"Context 1:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss. The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania. Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.  Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition ﷐Acute clinical case Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND  Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance) Atypical case Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others. Severe acute case Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization Suspected and confirmed chronic cases Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.   Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test     a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age        group).   b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the next level Collect specimens for confirming the cases Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmed Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy. Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. To avoid mosquito bites: Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs Use mosquito repellents Use mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoes Mosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

Q769,What information is crucial to report when responding to the Chikungunya alert threshold?,"Context 1: In IDSR, there are two types of thresholds used to initiate response: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. These thresholds are normally expressed in terms of the number (or proportion) of cases of a disease and the critical point (threshold) beyond which action must be taken. Trained health care personnel should always determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Statistical tools and methods may be applied to determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Thresholds for alerts and epidemic for epidemic prone diseases, conditions or events are shown in Section 11 of these  3rd Edition of the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 500
Context 2: 267 267Respond to alert threshold: Dracunculiasis﷐As a disease targeted for eradication, every rumour or suspected case of Guinea worm disease is an emergency. Follow up and investigate any rumour of dracunculiasis (within 24 hours of notification), using the national programme guidelines and WHO recommended forms, in order to determine whether or not there is a suspected case requiring further follow-up, monitoring and specimen collection for laboratory investigation. If a single case is suspected: Report the case according to national program guidelines for eradication of Dracunculiasis. Treat the wound (if any) to decrease disability associated with painful leg lesions. Collect and preserve specimen of any emerged worm in 70% alcohol, according to WHO /National guidelines for specimen handling, and send to WHO Country Office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC, for laboratory analysis Conduct case investigation to confirm risk factors and assess the source and burden of infection. Improve access to safe water according to national guidelines.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases monthly. Place:Plot distributions of localities (communities) from which cases have been reported. Person: Count monthly cases and analyse age distribution. Use data to forecast interventions. Report monthly to   next levels.﷐ Laboratory confirmation﷐A clinical diagnosis is usually made when the blister has ruptured, and the anterior end of the female worm can be seen, and the worm emerges. Current programme standards require that the emerged worm is sent to the laboratory for confirmation as D. medinensis. Several other worms emerging from the skin may mimic Guinea worm disease, notably onchocerciasis and sparganosis, and should be differentiated from dracunculiasis through laboratory confirmation.  Collect and preserve any emerged specimen according to WHO/ National guidelines for specimen handling and send to WHO Country office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for laboratory analysis (mandatory). , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 177
Context 3: Any suspected event occurring in the community including cases of maternal and neonatal deaths should be reported immediately. The trigger mechanisms of reporting must be clearly defined and the information must be immediately notified to a community focal person, if already identified, or to a nearby health facility. Minimum information collected should include:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 541"
Q772,Compare the standard case definitions for Chikungunya and Buruli Ulcer.,"Context 1:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss. The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania. Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.  Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition ﷐Acute clinical case Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND  Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance) Atypical case Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others. Severe acute case Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization Suspected and confirmed chronic cases Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.   Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test     a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age        group).   b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the next level Collect specimens for confirming the cases Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmed Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices.

Distribute treatment to health centres Treat all cases with appropriate antibiotics as recommended by National protocol.  ***If a neighbouring area to a population targeted for vaccination is considered to be at risk (cases early in the dry season, no recent relevant vaccination campaign, high population density), it should be included in a vaccination programme.  ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:In meningitis belt countries during epidemic season, graph weekly cases and deaths. Otherwise, graph monthly trends in cases and deaths.

Context 2: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur. Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days. There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries. Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed. Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera. Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

Q794,"Which pathogens cause Cholera, and how do they differ from those causing Bacterial Meningitis and Buruli Ulcer?","Context 1: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur. Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days. There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries. Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed. Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera. Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age. Please see Diarrhoea with dehydration summary guidelines.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea. To confirm an outbreak, collect and transport stool specimens transported in Cary-Blair medium. Do immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths when an outbreak is suspected., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 158
Context 2: Background﷐Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (SD1) is the most common cause of enteric infections and is transmitted from person-to-person through faecal-oral spread. Large scale outbreaks may be caused by SD1 with up to 30% of populations infected. The case fatality rate may approach 20% among young children and elderly persons with severe dehydration. The incubation period is from 1 to 4 days. Clinical illness is characterized by acute fever and bloody diarrhoea, and can also present with systemic symptoms and signs as well as dehydration especially in young children. Risk factor: overcrowded areas with unsafe water and poor sanitation (for example, refugee and famine populations). SD1 is frequently resistant to multiple antibiotics including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Enterohaemorrhagic and enteroinvasive E. coli and other bacteria or parasites such as Entamoeba histolytica may also cause bloody diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond to dysentery outbreaks promptly. Improve percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases and evaluate proportion verified as SD1. Determine antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the agents isolated (especially SD1) both for routine surveillance and during outbreaks.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A person with (abdominal pain) and diarrhoea with visible blood in stool. Confirmed case: Suspected case with stool culture positive for Shigella dysenteriae type1., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 168

For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness,  General and specific risk factors in African countries. Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team. ﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action. ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event. Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing. ﷐Respond to alert threshold Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem.  For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.  For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation. ﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management. For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on. ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret.

Q813,"What are the key components of the surveillance goal for Chikungunya, and why is it important to identify high-risk areas?","Context 1: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 120
Context 2: Member States in the African Region have thus recommended that IHR (2005) should be implemented in the context of IDSR. IHR (2005) is therefore not a separate surveillance system but rather requires countries to put in place a “sensitive, reliable and flexible surveillance system that meets international standards”. IDSR is a system with that potential and it will ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements. The IHR (2005) provides an opportunity to address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including PHEIC. Moreover, IHR also provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen surveillance and response systems, and to act as a potent driver for IDSR implementation. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 135
Context 3: During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 150"

Q817,"What are the recommended public health actions for diabetes, and why is the analysis of data important to understand trends?","Context 1: ₋          Data analysis is the systematic process of examining data to generate relevant information for timely and appropriate public health action to be taken. Surveillance data should be analysed routinely and the information interpreted for use in public health actions. Capacity for routine data analysis and interpretation should be established and maintained for epidemiological as well as laboratory data , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 167
Context 2: It is important to integrate to the extent possible, social science data that should be gathered too. Data on the context, socio-cultural information (including education, traditional practices, health seeking and health care giving behaviour, and beliefs) relevant to priority hazards and epidemic prone disease should also be obtained. This will help epidemiological data to be contextualized and for real intelligence, be created basing on the risks and shape possible health interventions., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1789

Q820,"Why should blood glucose measurements be carried out on the day and at the time requested, and who should be involved in the analysis of data for non-communicable diseases?","Context 1: When routine reports or line-listed records of the number of cases are sent to the district or national level, also send the necessary data for timeliness and completeness. This will help the other levels understand the situation more clearly and evaluate the quality of the data that is being sent. For example, if the report to the national level states that two cases of measles were detected during the month, it should also include information about the number of health facilities that have reported. It will make a difference to the other levels when they evaluate the information if the 2 cases occurred with only 20% rather than 100% of the units reporting. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 246
Context 2: The national level should compile the surveillance data received from all the districts. It national level should look for epidemics that were not identified by the districts. Follow up with areas where reporting continues to be unreliable or does not happen at all. Support the districts in providing assistance to the health facilities when they evaluate the measurements and take action to improve the situation. Provide feedback to each of the levels (national, district, health facility and community). , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 363
Context 3: Decide what information you want to show on the table. For example, consider analysis of measles cases and deaths by age group, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 846"
Q822,"Why are obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption considered modifiable risk factors for diabetes, and who should be targeted in community awareness activities?","Context 1: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases). The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption. The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million. Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%. The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the disease Monitor trends and risk factors Identify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural) Monitor prevention and control program activities, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 165

Context 3: Background﷐Hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP) is a chronic condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease related deaths are increasing in the African Region, and in 2000 accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the African Region. Prevalence ranges from 25% to 35% in adults aged 25 to 64 years. Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion worldwide and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the African Region are affected. Major risk factors for hypertension are ageing, lack of physical activity, obesity, and a diet high in salt and fat. Other risk factors include; tobacco and alcohol use. Lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP include; weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, increased physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Prevention of secondary illness by early detection and standardized treatment Estimation of disease burden and reduction of identified risk factors Monitor control and prevention activities﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected new case at first visit: Any individual presenting with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Confirmed case: Any individual presenting on at least two occasions with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. * Report only the first diagnosis of the case in the health centre﷐Recommended public health action: Hypertension﷐Health promotion for non-communicable diseases focusing on HBP should be established, including community-based education on behaviour change and adoption of healthy lifestyles Promote secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Graph cases quarterly to analyse trends. Place: Compare district trends with national and regional trends. Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.    *Data for non-communicable diseases is often analysed for long term trends﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Diagnostic is clinical.﷐Reference﷐WHO, Atlas of heart disease and stroke, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004. Non communicable Diseases: A strategy for the African Region, AFR/RC50/10 Cardiovascular Diseases in the African Region: Current situation and perspectives, AFR/RC55/12 http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/ http://www.afro.who.int/dnc/databases/afro infobase/index.html WHO CVD-risk management package for low-and medium resource settings. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure U.S. Department of health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH Publication No. 03-5233, December 2003 Handbook of Hypertension, Vol 20.

Q826,"What is the extent of the resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, and why is it important to establish treatment centers in localities where cases occur?","Context 1: When establishing a cholera treatment centres, the following should be considered when selecting a site:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1391
Context 2: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur. Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days. There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries. Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed. Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera. Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age. Please see Diarrhoea with dehydration summary guidelines.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea. To confirm an outbreak, collect and transport stool specimens transported in Cary-Blair medium. Do immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths when an outbreak is suspected., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 158

Q847,Who are the populations at highest risk for Diabetes Mellitus?,"Context 1: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases). The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption. The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million. Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%. The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007.

Q851,Why is it important to maintain strict infection prevention and control practices during an Ebola or Marburg outbreak?,"Context 1: or enhance death reporting and surveillance﷐Respond to action threshold: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐If a single case is confirmed: Notify authorities at the next level and the WHO Maintain strict VHF infection prevention and control practices throughout the outbreak (see separate Infection Prevention and control guidelines). Mobilize the community for early detection and care of cases and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement infection control in the home care setting and during funerals. Conduct case contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. Psychosocial support for family, community, and staff. Begin screening procedures for fever and VHF-like symptoms at the entrances to health care facilities with hand washing Request additional help from other levels as needed. Establish isolation ward to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre. Ensure there is a barrier between suspected cases and confirmed cases in an isolation unit. Quarantine high-risk contacts with home support during the incubation period. Low risk contacts under daily follow-up should be encouraged to limit their movements Begin surveillance and screening of dead bodies including: any individual aged 5 years or more, dying within 14 days of symptom onset from an indeterminate cause, OR still births.) Treat accompanying similar symptoms, in particular malaria, typhoid, fever, louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Implement IPC measures and avoid nosocomial transmission by strict implementation of barrier nursing. If barrier nursing material is not available, avoid any invasive procedure (e.g. blood sampling, injections, placement of infusion lines, or nasogastric tubes) and put on at least one layer of gloves for any direct contact with the patient; double gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that poses an increased risk for blood exposure. There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. For EVD, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated. ﷐Analyse and interpret data: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan disease control interventions accordingly. Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak. Place: Map locations of cases’ households.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Diagnostic test﷐Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the Ebola or Marburg virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Ebola/Marburg.﷐Specimen﷐For ELISA: Whole blood, serum or plasma For RT-PCR: Whole blood or blood clot, serum/plasma or tissue For immunohisto-chemistry: Skin or tissue specimens from fatal cases NB: RDTs theoretically can be performed in any health care setting and without additional equipment, however, use of an RDT may result in both false positive and false negative test results. A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available. However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.﷐When to collect﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case. If more than one suspected case, collect until specimens have been collected from 5 to10 suspected cases.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

Context 2: Background﷐The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses. Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo. More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007). These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented. Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved. Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures. Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days. Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses. High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%) There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.

Q854,What is the laboratory confirmation process for Ebola or Marburg virus diseases?,"Context 1: Background﷐The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses. Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo. More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007). These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented. Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved. Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures. Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days. Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses. High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%) There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used. Prevention efforts such as social distancing and vaccination should be supported. Monitoring case fatalities, assess spread of illness (chains of transmission), and death. Guide the support and care of survivors﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Routine Surveillance: Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine. Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak. Community-based surveillance: Alert case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area; OR At least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine; OR Any sudden death Actions to take: If an alert case (living or dead) is identified, report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre This definition of “alert cases” for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak. Note: During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local event In outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions may guide appropriate detection of cases: Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal (for Ebola) - a mine (for Marburg) OR Any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding; OR Any sudden, inexplicable death; OR A person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal (for Ebola); a mine (for Marburg) ﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Note: During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms, therefore, the case definition for suspected or confirmed case does not include it.

Q873,"What is hypertension, and how is it classified?","Context 1: Background﷐Hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP) is a chronic condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke.

Context 2: Background﷐Respiratory infections are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in the world. The mortality rates are particularly high among infants, children and the elderly. However, the burden of disease is not well characterized in Africa.  The most common pathogens causing respiratory infections are; Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), influenza virus An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of respiratory infections in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control). The threat of respiratory infections due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness.  Surveillance for respiratory infections, mainly the viral ones, is based on the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) case definition. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐Describe the seasonality of influenza  Signal the start and end of the influenza season Establish baseline or average levels of influenza and severe influenza-related disease Describe circulating viruses Identify locally circulating virus types and subtypes and their relationship to global and regional patterns Monitor antiviral sensitivity Identify and monitor groups at high-risk of severe disease and complications from infection Assist in understanding the relationship of virus strains to disease severity Generate influenza data that can be used to estimate influenza burden Detect unusual and unexpected events ﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with: measured fever ≥ 38 ºC  cough with onset within the last 10 days﷐Respond to an alert threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis.

Q887,Contrast the standard case definitions for influenza caused by a new subtype with those for ILI. Identify the key differences in criteria and parameters.,"Context 1: Influenza-like Illness (ILI), Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 193
Context 2: Influenza caused by a new subtype, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 189
Context 3: Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries. Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes. Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures. Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential. To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features. To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype 1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation: Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb]. Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case; Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other setting Probable case: A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human. Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed case c Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory. d An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes. Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype 2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9.

An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests.

Q897,"How should health authorities analyze and interpret data for lymphatic filariasis, and what criteria indicate successful control?","Context 1: Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on: Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occur Treatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention. Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori Modes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks. Clinical description: Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis). Chronic complications include: Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbs Damage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men) Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation: Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central level Sentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical), Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).  ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded. Confirmed case: A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case management Hygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis: Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and water Raising the affected limb at night Exercising to promote lymph flow Keeping nails short and clean Wearing comfortable footwear Using antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics. For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed: In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose. In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision. The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following: Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis: 400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 years Areas with no concurrent Onchocerciasis Diethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, or Diethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months. NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments). It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations. ﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administration Analyse the drug coverage in implementation units Assess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smear Filarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

Q902,"How should health authorities respond to alert and action thresholds for malaria, and what actions are recommended?","Context 1: The epidemic threshold for malaria in some countries is 3rd Quartile of confirmed malaria cases for the past 5 years; Alert threshold is 2nd quartile/Median of confirmed malaria cases, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 889
Context 2: It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines.  These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 102

Q903,"How should health authorities analyze and interpret malaria data, and what factors indicate a possible epidemic?","Context 1: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 558
Context 2: It is important to integrate to the extent possible, social science data that should be gathered too. Data on the context, socio-cultural information (including education, traditional practices, health seeking and health care giving behaviour, and beliefs) relevant to priority hazards and epidemic prone disease should also be obtained. This will help epidemiological data to be contextualized and for real intelligence, be created basing on the risks and shape possible health interventions., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1789
Context 3: Analyse and interpret data: Influenza caused by a new subtype ﷐  1-Manage the data use a line list and  establish procedures for record-keeping and data validation    2-Analyse the data Time:Construct an epidemic curve, with the weekly number of cases on the y-axis, and their date or time of illness onset on the x-axis. Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc.  These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.  Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event.  The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used: • Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.) • Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.). Person:  To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse:  • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases;  • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and  • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.  Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 191"
Q904,"How is the epidemic threshold set for malaria, and what factors are considered in determining the upper limit of expected cases?","Context 1: In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week):, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 209
Context 2: Note: Setting an epidemic threshold:, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 208

Q905,How is early detection and control of malaria epidemics ensured in epidemic-prone areas?,"Context 1: Note: Please note that to ensure early detection and control of malaria epidemics; it is preferable to use weekly surveillance data in Malaria epidemic prone areas., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 216
Context 2: In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week):, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 209
Context 3: Given the ecological distribution of communicable diseases and the porosity of international borders, it is imperative that countries in the region work together to control and contain them.  The free movement of people and goods across the borders within the region provides opportunities for cross-border spread of diseases. In addition, in the urban centres located at border points a disaster on one side of the border can easily affect the health of a large number of people on both sides of the borders. It is therefore logical that countries in the region engage each other in coordinated and synchronized implementation of interventions so as to control the communicable diseases in the region. Developing cross-border framework will therefore provide an opportunity for countries to initiate and strengthen priority cross-border activities for disease control, including but not limited to disease surveillance, epidemic preparedness and outbreak control as well as building core capacities to ensure compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005). Malawi has since established cross-border framework with its neighbouring countries Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and will work on the following to enhance compliance and build the core capacities, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 158"
Q912,What are the components of programs elaborated to eradicate malnutrition?,"Context 1: Intervention programs supported by WHO for prevention and control, eradication or elimination of the diseases exist. For example, the Expanded Program on Immunizations (EPI), the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI)., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 272
Context 2: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 706

Context 3: Public Health Surveillance is the ongoing systematic identification, collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action. It includes the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those who need to know for effective and appropriate action. Surveillance is also essential for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health practice.

(NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths) Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.   Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.  Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths.

Context 2: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa. Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively. The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life. Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition. Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease. Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification. Policy-making and planning. Programme management and evaluation. Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 220

Context 3: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa. Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively. The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life. Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition. Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease. Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification. Policy-making and planning. Programme management and evaluation. Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 220"

(NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths) Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.   Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.  Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live births Review of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Context 2: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.    Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.    The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths.   One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.            ﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by:  Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them; Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths  , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 245

Q951,What is the extent of the problem of maternal mortality globally?,"Context 1: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths) Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.   Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.  Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live births Review of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015. Intensified actions and increased investments are required to improve the coverage and quality of maternal health care services and addressing issues and factors contributing to these deaths are key if we are to achieve SDG  ﷐Surveillance goal﷐Active surveillance for improved and accurate identification and reporting of maternal deaths at community and facility level  Estimate and monitor maternal mortality rates. Identify underlying causes and contributing factors and high-risk areas for maternal mortality to inform program decisions. Evaluate programs aimed at reducing maternal mortality.﷐Standard case definition﷐The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the delivery or termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Maternal death﷐After determining that the death of a woman occurred during pregnancy or within 42 days of its termination, the initial notification of the suspected death should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible  Every maternal death is significant and this puts the alert threshold at ONE (1) The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility maternal death review committee is required to review the case within 7 days  The initial notification should be followed by a written report using a maternal death review form; and this should be shared with the district/ regional MDR coordinator MDR should be anonymous and unlinked; and the reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation   The initial notification should be followed by a written report using a maternal death review form/case investigation form.  ﷐Recommended public health action﷐Every death of a woman of reproductive health should be investigated to rule out pregnancy status and thereby establish whether it is a maternal death or not Surveillance for maternal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where women are seen or die. Monitor trends and respond to any maternal death based on recommendations from the Maternal death review Increase availability and use of antenatal care, and skilled birth attendance Implement evidence based high impact essential interventions for maternal health Educate and engage communities on emergency preparedness and complication readiness; including evidence based nutrition and dietary interventions for safe pregnancy and childbirth Address socio cultural norms and practices that negatively impact on maternal health  Ensure emergency obstetric care (EmOC) coverage of >80 % with recommended signal functions provided by level of care﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases to construct an epidemic curve throughout the year in order to identify trends. Place:Plot the location of cases and analyse the distribution. Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Reference: Maternal death﷐WHO Maternal Mortality http://www.who.int/making pregnancy safer/topics/maternal  mortality/en/index.html; ICD MM; http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70929/9789241548458_eng.pdf;jsessionid=862B3C6054CED65E30EDE6605FFAEDF4?sequence=1 WHO Technical guidance for MDSR; MEBC guidance UNICEF http://www.unicef.org/index.php, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 224
Context 2: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.    Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.    The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths.   One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.            ﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by:  Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them; Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths  , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 245

Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases. Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles.

Q968,"What is MERS, and what virus causes it?","Context 1: Background﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Surveillance Goal﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission To determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Standard case definition﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/ The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV) A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, who requires admission to hospital, with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation (clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised); AND any of the following: the person resides in the Middle East, in particular where human infections have been reported, and in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels; the patient is part of a cluster of acute respiratory illness that occurs within a 14 day period, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the disease occurs in a health care worker who has been working in an environment where patients with severe acute respiratory infections are being cared for, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the person develops an unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment, without regard to place of residence or history of travel, even if another aetiology has been identified that fully explains the clinical presentation. A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, and who has travelled within 14 days before onset of illness to the Middle East2 or countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred. Individuals with acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had any of the following exposures (Note: see section on Recommendations for testing in clusters associated with health care settings): close physical contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection, while that patient was ill; a healthcare facility in a country where hospital-associated MERS-CoV infections have been reported; direct contact with dromedary camels or consumption or exposure to dromedary camel products (raw meat, unpasteurized milk, urine) in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camel populations or where human infections occurred as a result of presumed zoonotic transmission. Countries in the Middle East2 are also strongly encouraged to consider adding testing for MERS-CoV to current testing algorithms as part of routine sentinel respiratory disease surveillance and diagnostic panels for pneumonia. WHO case definitions for MERS-CoV can be found here http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html Confirmed case definition A person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection,1 irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/) 2 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include: Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 228

Q969,What are the typical symptoms of MERS?,"Context 1: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 227
Context 2: Background﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Surveillance Goal﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission To determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Standard case definition﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/ The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV) A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, who requires admission to hospital, with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation (clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised); AND any of the following: the person resides in the Middle East, in particular where human infections have been reported, and in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels; the patient is part of a cluster of acute respiratory illness that occurs within a 14 day period, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the disease occurs in a health care worker who has been working in an environment where patients with severe acute respiratory infections are being cared for, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the person develops an unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment, without regard to place of residence or history of travel, even if another aetiology has been identified that fully explains the clinical presentation. A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, and who has travelled within 14 days before onset of illness to the Middle East2 or countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred. Individuals with acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had any of the following exposures (Note: see section on Recommendations for testing in clusters associated with health care settings): close physical contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection, while that patient was ill; a healthcare facility in a country where hospital-associated MERS-CoV infections have been reported; direct contact with dromedary camels or consumption or exposure to dromedary camel products (raw meat, unpasteurized milk, urine) in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camel populations or where human infections occurred as a result of presumed zoonotic transmission. Countries in the Middle East2 are also strongly encouraged to consider adding testing for MERS-CoV to current testing algorithms as part of routine sentinel respiratory disease surveillance and diagnostic panels for pneumonia. WHO case definitions for MERS-CoV can be found here http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html Confirmed case definition A person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection,1 irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Probable case definition A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is unavailable, negative on a single inadequate specimen3 or inconclusive4 A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) that cannot be explained fully by any other aetiologyANDThe person resides or travelled in the Middle East, or in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4 An acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4 Notes 1 A case may be laboratory confirmed by detection of viral nucleic acid or serology. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/) 2 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include: Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 228

Q972,What is the surveillance goal for MERS?,"Context 1: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98
Context 2: Member States in the African Region have thus recommended that IHR (2005) should be implemented in the context of IDSR. IHR (2005) is therefore not a separate surveillance system but rather requires countries to put in place a “sensitive, reliable and flexible surveillance system that meets international standards”. IDSR is a system with that potential and it will ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements. The IHR (2005) provides an opportunity to address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including PHEIC. Moreover, IHR also provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen surveillance and response systems, and to act as a potent driver for IDSR implementation. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 135
Context 3: The purpose of evaluation of a surveillance system is to assess the effectiveness of the system and response system in terms of timeliness, quality of data, preparedness, case management, overall performance and using the indicators to identify gaps or areas that could be strengthened. A comprehensive evaluation should thus include the surveillance system and if already available the IDSR Implementation Plan. The evaluation of the surveillance system should: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 342"
Q974,How should specimens be collected for laboratory confirmation of MERS?,"Context 1: The type of specimen collected and its packaging (storage media) depends on the suspected disease. Specimens should be collected in adequate quantity into appropriate containers at the healthcare facility level or, if necessary, in the field during an outbreak investigation. All specimens must be triple packaged and labelled correctly and accompanied with the correct laboratory forms in order to arrive at the laboratory in good condition, and provide reliable results. Minimize delays between collection of the specimen and processing in the laboratory. Use of sample tracking forms (chain of custody) shall be encouraged in order to enable tracking of the samples form the send to the receiver and back. The tracking and feedback mechanism shall be well developed and implemented within the National Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) through the digital health support., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 210
Context 2: 4.2.2 Collect laboratory specimens and obtain laboratory results to confirm the diagnosis, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 292
Context 3: in the same close environment of a individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Working together in close proximity or sharing the same environment with individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Traveling together with individuals infected with MERS-CoV in any kind of conveyance Living in the same household as individuals infected with MERS-CoV. The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14-day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration. 3 An inadequate specimen would include a nasopharyngeal swab without an accompanying lower respiratory specimen, a specimen that has had improper handling, is judged to be of poor quality by the testing laboratory, or was taken too late in the course of illness. 4 Inconclusive tests may include: A positive test by nucleic acid amplification assay for a single target without further testing. Evidence of sero-reactivity by a single convalescent serum sample ideally taken at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens. Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat nasopharyngeal specimen with additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory tract specimens are not possible, and appropriately timed paired acute and convalescent sera. Other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood/serum, urine and stool. These generally have lower titres of virus than respiratory tract specimens but have been used to confirm cases when other specimens were inadequate or unobtainable. Laboratories which obtain discordant PCR testing results and have limited experience in detecting MERS-CoV should consider referring their specimens to laboratories with greater experience for confirmation.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Refer to the WHO case reporting form (available in English and French) Responding to an alert ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐If a single case/cluster or outbreak is suspected: All health care workers who collect specimens from patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, and Standard and droplet infection control precautions are sufficient when collecting biological samples from suspected patients. Additional precautions are required when aerosol-generating procedures are performed on a patient All those involved in collection and transporting specimens should be trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination procedures. WHO requests that probable and confirmed cases be reported within 24 hours of classification, through the regional contact point for International Health Regulations at the appropriate WHO regional office. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Proper and respectful burial or cremation (if practiced) of dead bodies (humans) Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to use infection control in the home care setting (see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-infection/en/) Efforts to identify additional cases beyond close contacts are critical for prevention and control of infection, and to determine the total extent of transmission in the community. Active case finding in the area under investigation should focus on: Patients currently admitted to health care facilities in the community where the confirmed MERS-CoV case was discovered. Any patients currently in the hospital with unexplained SARI should be considered for testing for MERS-CoV. Health care providers in the community; health workers should be interviewed about recent cases of unexplained pneumonia and notified to immediately report any patients who have signs and symptoms that meet the case definition developed for the investigation as described above in section 3.4.1. Patients meeting the case definition should be tested for MERS-CoV. Patients who recently died of an unexplained illness consistent with the case definition developed for the investigation should be tested for MERS-CoV infection if appropriate clinical specimens are available. Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases should be identified and monitored for the appearance of respiratory symptoms for 14 days after last exposure to the confirmed or suspected case, while the case was symptomatic. Any contact that becomes ill in that period of time should be tested for MERS-CoV. If feasible, all contacts especially health care workers and other inpatient hospital contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms should be tested for MERS-CoV.

Upper respiratory tract samples have yielded negative results in some symptomatic close contacts of confirmed cases, who later developed pneumonia and tested positive on lower respiratory specimens. It is WHO has strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage be collected for MERS-CoV testing where possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected.

Context 2: Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed: Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak. Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies. Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. Request additional help from other levels as needed. Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings. Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases. Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff. Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements. There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers. Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes. A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

Q979,Where does Monkeypox primarily occur?,"Context 1: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children. Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates.  Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating. Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak. Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity. Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years. Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains. The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body. The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts.  Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand. Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case. Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed. Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 230

Context 2: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections. Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally. The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980. The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others. The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing. Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %). Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower. The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden. In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity. WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease. Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 278

Q985,Name some countries that have reported human cases of Monkeypox.,"Context 1: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children. Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates.  Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating. Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak. Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity. Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years. Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains. The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body. The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts.  Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand. Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case. Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed. Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 230
Context 2: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections. Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally. The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980. The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others. The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing. Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %). Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing.

However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand. Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case. Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed. Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 230"

Context 2: Laboratory confirmation: MonkeyPox﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Typical practices associated with collection of patient specimens are appropriate for collection of orthopoxvirus lesions as well. These include wearing personal protective equipment, including gloves and sanitizing the site prior to collection. If alcohol is used to prepare the lesion for collection it is important to allow the lesion to dry before it is collected.  Biopsy specimens: Aseptically place two to four portions of tissue into a dry, sterile, leakproof, freezable container. Storage -20 °C to - 70 °C. Transport ~6h at 4 °C. Note: package non-formalin lesion biopsy for shipping on dry ice, leave formalin fixed biopsy at room temperature. Do not freeze formalin fixed biopsy sample.  Scabs: Aseptically place scrapings/material into a dry, sterile, leak-proof, freezable container. No viral transport media. Storage - 20 °C to - 70 °C. Transport ~6h at 4 °C.  Vesicular fluid: Collect fluid from separate lesions onto separate sterile swabs. Be sure to include cellular material from the base of each respective vesicule. Storage -20 °C to - 70 °C. Transport ~6h at 4 °C. No viral transport media.  Blood Draw 10 ml of blood into a plastic marble-topped tube, or a plastic yellow-topped serum separator tube. Note: approval must be obtained prior to the shipment of potential monkeypox patient clinical specimens to a reference laboratory.﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for monkeypox are not routinely available at present.

Q994,"What is AIDS, and what causes it?","Context 1: Background AIDS is an infection of human lymphocytes (types of white blood cells) and other organs. It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others. Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region. Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years. Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers. Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS). Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted. Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission. Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TB Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology. Improve HIV/AIDS screening.﷐Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions.

Context 2: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries. The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever. Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe. Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases. Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density. Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly: In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM). ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles. Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility. If an outbreak is suspected: Report suspected case to the next level. Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak. Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible. Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility. If an outbreak is confirmed: Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage. Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment. Provide Vitamin A:  Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day  Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths.

Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer. Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube. If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning. If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube. Store serum at 4°C. Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport. ﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days. If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed. Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected. To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean. Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf  WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1  World Health Organization.

Context 3: Background﷐Infections of the human genito-urinary and reproductive systems transmitted via human sexual contact (sexually transmitted disease, STIs). The most common causes of male urethral discharge are a) the gonococcus Neisseria gonorrhoea and b) Chlamydia trachomatis. The most common causes of male and female genital ulcer are c) syphilis (Treponema pallidum), d) herpes simplex virus (HSV1 or 2) and e) chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi). STIs are endemic in most countries of the world, including countries in Africa. Multiple simultaneous STIs are common (for example, gonorrhoea plus Chlamydia). STIs may be most highly prevalent in areas where HIV occurs and may facilitate HIV transmission. STIs may be primary or from repeated attacks of urethral discharge. STIs are a leading cause of abortion and stillbirth, prematurity, and congenital infections. They may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of decreased fertility. Incubation periods for gonorrhoea are 2 to 7 days; Chlamydia 7 to 14 days (or longer); syphilis, 10 days to 12 weeks (usually around 3 weeks), and chancroid, 3 to 14 days. STIs may be more commonly diagnosed in men, in whom clinical evidence of infection may be more readily apparent.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection and treatment of STI reduces transmission rates. Active efforts to diagnose latent syphilis may prevent significant disability. Improve early and effective treatment of STIs using simple algorithms based on syndromic diagnosis for index cases and partners. Carry out laboratory-based anti-microbial sensitivity monitoring and modify treatment guidelines accordingly at the national level. Compare surveillance data for both STIs and HIV/AIDS since STIs may reflect co-presence of HIV.﷐Standard case definition﷐Genital ulcer syndrome (non-vesicular): Suspected case: Any male with an ulcer on the penis, scrotum, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy, or any female with ulcer on labia, vagina, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy. Confirmed case: Any suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method. Urethral discharge syndrome: Suspected case: Any male with urethral discharge with or without dysuria. Confirmed case: Urethral discharge syndrome: A suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method (for example Gram stain showing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci).﷐Public health action﷐Conduct active case finding for specific target groups. Conduct primary prevention activities such as promotion of safer sexual behaviours and provision of condoms. Assess use of algorithms for detection and treatment of STIs. And improve health worker practice with algorithms. Include STI prevention and care services in maternal and child health, and family planning services. Target acceptable and effective STI prevention and care services to populations identified as vulnerable to STI transmission. Promote early STI health seeking behaviour.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases each quarter. Place:No recommendation for analysis of place. Person:Count quarterly cases and analyse age distribution.﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Reference﷐Guidelines for Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance.

Q1000,What is the surveillance goal for HIV/AIDS?,"Context 1: Disease-specific surveillance: This involves surveillance activities aimed at targeted health data for a specific disease for vertical surveillance. Examples include Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV surveillance systems., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 85
Context 2: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98

Q1007,"What are the targets set by the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s, and Adolescents’ Health regarding neonatal mortality and stillbirths?","Context 1: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.    Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.    The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths.   One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.            ﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by:  Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them; Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths  , Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 245
Context 2: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa. Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively. The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life. Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition. Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease. Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification. Policy-making and planning. Programme management and evaluation. Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 220

Context 2: Standard case definitions: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Perinatal death includes the death of a baby of at least 28 weeks of gestation and/or 1,000 g in weight and early neonatal death (the first seven days after birth)  A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 g birthweight and/or at least 28 weeks gestation and 35 cm long.   Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life. Day 1 is clinically considered the first day of life.    Late neonatal death is defined as any death of live newborn occurring days 8 through 28 after birth.  ﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐After determining that a perinatal death has occurred, the initial notification should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible  The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility or the district perinatal death review committee is required to review the case within seven (7) days  PDR should be anonymous.  It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicable The reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation  ﷐Recommended public health action﷐In many low-income countries, it is not possible to review all perinatal deaths given the large numbers of deaths and the limited capacity in human resources and time. However, it is important to accurately capture and classify the causes of those deaths Selected perinatal death should be reviewed and investigated to ascertain the cause. Surveillance for perinatal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where they occur. Response to any perinatal death is based on recommendations from the perinatal death review. Findings from review of the selected perinatal death should lead to actions to prevent similar deaths by identifying gaps that should be addressed at policy level and in both health facilities and communities. Monthly, quarterly or semi-annual analysis of aggregated data at larger health facilities and at district level  can lead to a more comprehensive approach  to address a particular problem across multiple facilities or communities or a problem in particular geographical areas where  they are occurring in greater numbers.  These should be conducted alongside those for maternal deaths by the MPDSR committee.    ﷐Analyse and interpret data: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Measures of magnitude  Number of stillbirths (SBR) Number of early neonatal deaths (NMR) Causes of stillbirths Causes of early neonatal deaths % of stillbirths and neonatal deaths due to avoidable factors  Descriptive analysis by person, place and time: Gestational age at time of death, Socioeconomic status of family, educational levels of parents  Time and date of death, weekday or weekend.

The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons. Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg. Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong. Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals. The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine.  Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission. Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks. Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases.

Q1052,In what ways do the standard case definitions for tuberculosis and typhoid fever differ?,"Context 1: Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually.  In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers. Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection. Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries. People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread.

Q1057,"What is the risk associated with untreated tuberculosis, especially in individuals with HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromising conditions?","Context 1: Background AIDS is an infection of human lymphocytes (types of white blood cells) and other organs. It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others. Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region. Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years. Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers. Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS). Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted. Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission. Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TB Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology. Improve HIV/AIDS screening.﷐Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions. A positive ELISA for confirming HIV and a rapid test for confirming the positive results are sufficient for an epidemiologic case definition for HIV infection.﷐Public health actions﷐Monitor local STI and opportunistic infections, including TB, as possible cofactor for HIV. Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology. Monitor use of condoms by commercial sex workers. Provide voluntary counselling and testing services at district and sub-district levels. Treatment of individual cases with antiretroviral therapy is not yet widely available in most African countries. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection (OI) may prolong life expectancy but this has not been widely evaluated in developing countries. Promote condom use, especially among high-risk individuals. Treat STIs, especially syphilis, chancroid diseases, and other ulcerative processes. Mobilize non-paid blood donors and promote appropriate use of blood. Promote good infection control practices within health facilities in the district. Educate patients and their sexual partners to refrain from donating blood, tissues, semen or breast milk.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Count new HIV/AIDS cases and report monthly. Analyse by number of cases confirmed with serology. At the end of the year, calculate the total number of cases and include trends for HIV sero-surveillance, STI surveillance and results of any special studies (socio-behavioural studies, drug sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, and so on).﷐Laboratory confirmation: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐Diagnostic test﷐Adults and children 18 months or older: HIV infection is diagnosed based on: - Positive HIV antibody testing (rapid or laboratory- based enzyme immunoassay). This is confirmed by a second HIV antibody test (rapid or laboratory-based enzyme immunoassay) relying on different antigens or of different operating characteristics; AND/ OR - Positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen assay) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determination Children younger than 18 months: HIV infection is diagnosed based on positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determination taken more than four weeks after birth. Positive HIV antibody testing is not recommended for definitive or confirmatory diagnosis of HIV infection in children until 18 months of age.﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Obtain specimens according to national HIV/AIDS program strategy for clinical or epidemiological sampling.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen﷐Use universal precautions to minimize exposure to sharps and any body fluid.

Context 2: Background﷐Infection of the lungs and other organs usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmitted person-to-person by droplet infection through coughing, sneezing or spitting. Clinically, the pulmonary form of the disease is more common than the extra-pulmonary form. The cardinal symptoms of pulmonary TB are chronic cough, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite and night sweats. Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious illness and death worldwide with over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year. In African countries, approximately 1.6 million of the new cases and over 600 000 cases occur each year. It is also estimated that between 30 and 50% of all new TB cases detected are infected with HIV and 40% of all AIDS deaths are due to TB. Those who are at highest risk of dying from TB include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and other immuno-compromising conditions, the very young, and the very old. The global HIV pandemic has been a major cause of increasing TB cases, especially in African countries. Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months. WHO recommends the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy to maximize compliance and treatment efficacy and to reduce development of drug-resistant strains. The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region. Varying degrees of success have been achieved in controlling TB where resources and motivation for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow up are adequate. Clinically, bacterial pneumonia, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS and a variety of other bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes of fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, or may themselves precipitate active TB in an already infected individual. Abdominal or other extra-pulmonary sites of infection may occur after ingestion of un-pasteurized cow’s milk (M. bovis).﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of persons with infectious lung disease to improve chances of clinical improvement and reduce transmission of TB. Improve percentage of TB cases confirmed by microscope, Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 286

Q1060,"Where can additional information on tuberculosis and typhoid fever be found, and why are these resources important for health professionals and authorities?","Context 1: Respond to alert threshold﷐If Typhoid fever cases are suspected: Arrange for laboratory testing of stool specimens or rectal swabs of suspected cases, especially in situations where food- or waterborne transmission is suspected. Report and investigate all suspected outbreaks of typhoid. Search for case/carrier that is the source of infection and for the vehicle (water or food) through which infection is being transmitted. Treat typhoid fever patients with antibiotics. Severe cases should be provided supportive measures such as oral or intravenous hydration, the use of antipyretics, and appropriate nutrition.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Typhoid Fever cases are confirmed Initiate a line list/register for cases Identify areas/populations at high risk to identify source(s) and mode(s) of transmission in order to prevent and control the disease. Conduct health education programmes on hygiene with simple messages on safe water, safe food handling practices, hygiene and handwashing. Work with water authorities to support provision of clean water and proper sanitation to affected population(s). Chlorinate suspected water supplies. All drinking water should be chlorinated or boiled before use. More than 90% of patients can be managed at home with oral antibiotics, reliable care and close medical follow-up for complications or failure to respond to therapy. Patients with persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea and abdominal distension may require hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic therapy.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly.

Context 2: 3.1.4. Typhoid Fever- 1 case was reported in week 25. A confirmed case by KCH. (Annex 3) , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 464
Context 3: Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually.  In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers. Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection. Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries. People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verification Identify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures﷐Standard case definitions﷐Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea. Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool., Reference: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph: 289"
Q1066,Why is case-based surveillance particularly important for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication?,"Context 1: -          Proportion of cases of diseases targeted for elimination, eradication and any other disease selected for case-based surveillance reported with case-based forms or line lists , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 165
Context 2: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 81
Context 3: 3.     Proportion of cases of diseases targeted for elimination, eradication and any other diseases selected for case-based surveillance that were reported to the district using case-based or line-listing forms , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 491"
Q1068,Who is responsible for reporting individual cases immediately in case-based surveillance systems?,"Context 1: Information that is reported immediately, such as single cases or clusters of reportable events, will generate an alert and initiate a case-based surveillance reporting system. This means that, specific information about that suspected case or if it is a cluster, specific information of each of cases identified, will be collected thoroughly and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at PoE, information is reported to the next level (district where the PoE is situated) as well as simultaneously to the IHR NFP. Reporting units with no diagnostic capacity will use the suspected case definition given to identify and report diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, information of contacts will be collected. Section 4 describes to how to conduct contact tracing and also how to report contacts., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 498
Context 2: Immediate reporting of case-based information allows for early detection of unexpected or highly pathogenic/lethal public health events. All the diseases and conditions under immediate reporting should also be reported under aggregated weekly report in the Weekly IDSR Summary Reporting Form., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 488
Context 3: Sensitize staffs on diseases or conditions that require immediate reporting for case-based surveillance including potential PHEIC and other priority diseases or events of national concern. For example, all the health staff should be aware of epidemic-prone diseases for which a single suspected or probable case is a suspected outbreak requiring immediate action, and of any unusual or unexplained event with potential for affecting human health., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 596"
Q1070,"Where are sentinel sites typically located, and why are they chosen?","Context 1: Sentinel surveillance: This type of surveillance is done for specific conditions in a specific cohort such as in a geographical area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. A given number of health facilities or reporting sites are usually designated as sentinel sites for monitoring rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance and they act as early warning and reporting sites. Sentinel sites are usually designated because they are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. Examples of sentinel surveillance include: sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 82
Context 2: Choose the immunization sites and inform the community., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1105
Context 3: Is the reported surveillance information representative enough of the reporting site’s catchment area? Out of all the sites that should report, what proportion has actually reported?, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 743"
Q1073,"Why is disease-specific surveillance important, and who benefits from it?","Context 1: Disease-specific surveillance: This involves surveillance activities aimed at targeted health data for a specific disease for vertical surveillance. Examples include Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV surveillance systems., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 85
Context 2: It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 70
Context 3: Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 119"
Q1074,"Who is involved in Community Based Surveillance (CBS), and what are its main strategies?","Context 1: Steps for establishing Community Based Surveillance (CBS) , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 438
Context 2: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 431
Context 3: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 86"
Q1076,Where is every individual case reported in case-based surveillance?,"Context 1: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 81
Context 2: Record information of all cases on a “case based surveillance reporting form” (See sample Annex 2F). At least record the following:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 312
Context 3: Regularly sharing surveillance data addressing case counts (including zero cases if applicable) and status of contact tracing (if indicated) , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 672"
Q1082,Which types of events are monitored in event-based surveillance?,"Context 1: Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 88
Context 2: 8.4.1 Monitoring events from community based surveillance. 14 , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 34
Context 3: Unlike indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is not based on the routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action but rather on the screening of ALL available information to detect any event happening in the community (unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual or clustering of cases, events/conditions in the community, including environmental conditions). , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 94"
Q1084,Why is event-based surveillance considered sensitive?,"Context 1: Event based Surveillance systems are very sensitive.

Q1086,Where do event-based surveillance alerts intersect with indicator-based surveillance (IBS)?,"Context 1: Event-based Surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) are components of Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR) and epidemic intelligence incorporated in the IDSR strategy. Both EBS and IBS are complimentary with each having a different role to play and purpose. EBS is most likely to pick up alerts to detect small outbreaks early, while IBS is better in monitoring disease trends over time and useful for signalling the start of regular seasonal outbreaks of endemic diseases using alert and epidemic thresholds. IBS may not be useful for smaller events because alerts are either averaged out in large data sets, or lost in smaller data sets. EBS is also better at picking up alerts indicating outbreaks in areas where access to healthcare is limited. In the context of IDSR strategy, the flow of EBS information follows the same reporting lines as IBS i.e. from community to health facility to district and to national level. EBS and IBS are applied at all levels of the health system namely community, health facility, district and national levels (Illustrated in figure 2)., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 99

DRM is driven by conducting Hazard Analysis, followed by the assessment on the level of vulnerability and available coping capacity. The ultimate objective of DRM is reducing risk by reducing vulnerability or improving the capacity to mitigate impact of a hazard. IDSR is an important tool in the DRM, as it provides early warning information, which is crucial for risk assessment and ultimately, risk reduction.

Q1103,"What tool is used by most countries to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and response systems?","Context 1: Most countries have used an assessment tool developed by WHO/AFRO to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response systems and to identify where improvements are needed. Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. The assessment provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. The national strategic plan could also be used as reference while preparing a district specific action plan. For other countries, who have undergone JEE, the NAPHS (National Action Plan for Health Security) can also be used., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 311
Context 2: Periodically the quality of the surveillance system should be assessed based on these attributes. Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 210
Context 3: In recent years, technological and analytical innovations have emerged as an approach which can be used to facilitate rapid transmission of public health surveillance information, consequently aiding timely detection of and response to outbreaks and other public health events. The application of e-tools in the health sector has the potential to provide real-time validated data for public health surveillance, investigation and prompt outbreak response. eIDSR provides new opportunities for acceleration of the achievement of the IHR (2005) core capacities.  , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 521"
Q1104,Where can the national strategic plan be used as a reference?,"Context 1: Most countries have used an assessment tool developed by WHO/AFRO to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response systems and to identify where improvements are needed. Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. The assessment provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. The national strategic plan could also be used as reference while preparing a district specific action plan. For other countries, who have undergone JEE, the NAPHS (National Action Plan for Health Security) can also be used., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 311
Context 2: According to IHR, member states shall use existing national structures and resources to meet their core capacity requirements. These requirements include capacity for surveillance, reporting, notification, verification, response and collaboration activities. Each part is expected to assess the ability of existing national structures and resource to meet the minimum requirements. Based on the results of the assessment, each member state should develop and implement action plan to ensure that these core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 494
Context 3: Note: At national level, an equivalent of the above should be used in order to ensure a more comprehensive multi-sectoral structure. Consider at national level, to include directors from other key relevant ministries, heads of agencies, National Health Research Institutes (Human and Animal). The members from the IHR National Focal Point should always be part of the National Team Composition., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 572"
Q1105,Which sources of information about health events are defined in the district?,"Context 1: Define the sources of information about health events in the district, including points of contact the community has with health services. For example, list the following sources on a list of district reporting sites, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 315
Context 2: Define the sources of information about health events in the community, including points of contact that the community has with health services. A key informant selected from these sources can form community networks that support the VHCs in early detection of alerts; for example, sensitizing the women and men that often visit the grain milling or tea drinking places. The sources of information include:, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 442
Context 3: District staff may identify sources in the community with opportunity to know about the community’s health status. Examples of community sources include:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 619"
Q1106,Who should the national strategic plan and the assessment tools serve?,"Context 1: Most countries have used an assessment tool developed by WHO/AFRO to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response systems and to identify where improvements are needed. Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events.

Q1119,Where do humanitarian emergencies typically occur?,"Context 1: Humanitarian emergencies  have major implications on the populations where they occur and on their health services including surveillance systems (WHO, 2012). Emergencies typically result in population displacement to congested settings where access to basic needs like water, food, shelter, and other social services are constrained. These conditions thus increase the risk of death from common epidemic and endemic diseases. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 82
Context 2: 10.1.1.2 Humanitarian emergency, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 91
Context 3: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 87"
Q1121,Who defines a disaster in the context of emergency situations?,"Context 1: Disaster is defined as the serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society, causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses exceeding the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. In 2012, the African region member states, including Malawi, adopted the Disaster Risk Management (DRM): A strategy for the health sector in the African Region, which aims to comprehensively address DRM., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 155
Context 2: A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources (International Strategy for Disaster Reduction [ISDR], 2009). A disaster is also defined as a situation or event, which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating additional national or international assistance (Center for Research on Environmental Decisions [CRED, ReliefWeb, 2008)., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 90
Context 3: 10.1.1 Key definitions in Emergency contexts	2, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 20"
Q1124,What is a humanitarian emergency?,"Context 1: A humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single and/or ongoing UN country programme (ReliefWeb, 2008)., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 94

Context 3: 10.1.1.2 Humanitarian emergency, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 91"
Q1129,Where does early warning operate in the surveillance system?,"Context 1: Early warning is an organized mechanism to detect as early as possible any abnormal occurrence or any divergence from the usual or normally observed frequency of diseases, conditions and events. It relies on a network of people either from functional static or mobile health facilities/clinics that are responsible for the collection, investigation, reporting, analysis and dissemination of information from the field to the central level for appropriate action., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 96
Context 2: ₋    Public health surveillance systems are only useful if they provide data for appropriate public health response and control. For an early warning system, the capacity to respond to detected outbreaks and emerging public health threats needs to be assessed. This can be done following a major outbreak response and containment to document the quality and impact of public health response and control. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 185
Context 3: Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 88"
Q1130,Which public health problems should be the focus of the tailored IDSR during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency?,"Context 1: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98
Context 2: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 87
Context 3: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 83"
Q1132,Why is early warning needed in humanitarian emergencies?,"Context 1: During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 150

Q1152,How do indicator-based and event-based surveillance systems complement each other in IDSR?,"Context 1: 1.2.3 Event- based surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) as back-bone to the IDSR Strategy	8, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 22
Context 2: To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012), Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 113
Context 3: 1.2.3 Event- based surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) as back-bone to the IDSR Strategy, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 98"
Q1159,What role does the PHEOC play in the coordination of data during humanitarian crises?,"Context 1: The overall coordination of data collection, entry, analysis and dissemination during humanitarian crises should be undertaken by the IDSR unit within the Ministry of Health (MoH) with support from WHO and partners, and fed as necessarily to the PHEOC if one already exists. If the PHEOC exists, the National Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) coordinated by the national PHEOC is activated to support the coordination and response activities in the affected regions and districts. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacity of the national surveillance coordination unit in the MoH is greatly constrained, a coordinator (typically an epidemiologist or public health expert with experience in disease surveillance and disease control in emergencies) can be recruited to support the Ministry of Health during the acute phase of the crisis (WHO, 2012). The functions of the coordinator will be guided by the initial rapid assessment and   should include but not be limited to:, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 128
Context 2: The PHEOC monitors events using various sources of data; facilitates and improves communication between public health and emergency management personnel, and facilitates coordination with multiple response partners. The PHEOC feeds into the National Disaster Risk Management EOC to manage escalated events of national magnitude. It is highly recommended that the PHEOC is positioned at the national and district levels where there are already structures mandating the coordination for public health emergencies. At national level, the PHEOC is placed at PHIM which is answerable to the Secretary for Health.  At district level, it is located at the office of the DHSS who is answerable to the District Commissioner., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 519
Context 3: Having a centre for command and control is essential for preparedness and response to public health events. If resources allow, districts will need to have PHEOCs, with basic facilities that support direct coordination of preparedness and response to public health emergencies and facilitate real time communication and information between various stakeholders at their levels, but also ensuring there is a mechanism of sharing information with the national level PHEOC. At district level, the PHERRT performs the roles of PHEOC.  , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 522"
Q1161,What are the key activities conducted by district-level focal points during humanitarian crises?,"Context 1: The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacities of or national/central surveillance focal points are constrained, WHO country office working in close collaboration with the health cluster should assign a partner or a focal point in each affected district to:, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 137
Context 2: Participating in containment and response activities in coordination with the district level., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 545
Context 3: Support the IDSR focal person at the district level to implement planned activities, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 586"
Q1166,Who should be responsible for ensuring the availability of quality-assured WHO-approved RDT kits during a crisis?,"Context 1: Quality assured WHO approved Point of care Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits for diseases like Malaria, Cholera, Meningitis, and Hepatitis A and E are essential for timely treatment and outbreak response decisions. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 168
Context 2: To conduct verification, the district RRT will ask questions of the person reporting the alert, and possibly other people as well. This can include the patient, the family and friends of the patient and/or other people within the community., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 381
Context 3: Once an outbreak or event is confirmed, the District Health Management Team (DHMT) will work with the District Commissioner or Chief Executive Officer to convene the PHEMC to assess and implement the response. They will also activate the IMS (Refer to Section 5). The following further steps should take place:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 715"
Q1169,Where should the feedback be disseminated to engage all stakeholders effectively?,"Context 1: All stakeholders should be involved at onset throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation phases. Communities should be empowered to assist in making decisions and to implement and manage the preparedness and response. The stakeholders to be engaged include the Traditional leaders, Civil Society, faith based leaders, youth and women church associations, Faith Based Organisations, Community Based Organisations, Non-governmental Organisations, Political leaders, Community structures such as ADCs, VDCs, CHAGS, VHCS, HCMCS, HMCs, mother care group, vulnerable groups and the community members themselves. The engagement with these stakeholders should be on a continuous basis for better outcomes. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1619
Context 2: All stakeholders need to be engaged to raise awareness on their roles on Community emergency preparedness and response Program in the country. The stakeholders have vital roles on community engagement to support in the delivery of community health in the country and in turn engage with their communities on uptake of these services. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1640
Context 3: Effective coordination of response activities is also critical, as many actors/stakeholders will be involved. It is essential that all actors/stakeholders be identified in advance including their areas of support, roles and responsibilities to enable smooth response during an epidemic or any other public health event. This is the role of the PHEMC, which through the activation of the PHEOC, they will ensure effective coordination of the response activities across different sectors and donors (as discussed in Section 5)., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 707"
Q1172,Why is regular supervision and support crucial for enhancing surveillance functions at all levels?,"Context 1: A resource for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 234
Context 2: Both systems should be established to ensure all information from the community is captured and quickly reported to a designated surveillance focal person at the next level for follow up. Moreover, these two elements of surveillance should be integrated at the community level., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 437
Context 3: 10.5.8 Support functions for surveillance in crisis affected populations , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 219"
Q1173,What are the critical aspects of feedback and dissemination in the context of IDSR during a humanitarian crisis?,"Context 1: 10.3 Implementation of IDSR in humanitarian emergencies, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 114
Context 2: 10.3 Implementation of IDSR in humanitarian emergencies	4, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 28
Context 3: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 87"
Q1175,How does outbreak preparedness in crisis-affected populations differ from standard preparedness practices?,"Context 1: Outbreak preparedness is paramount given the heightened risk of disease outbreaks in crisis affected populations. Preparedness efforts should as much as possible be integrated in the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the Ministry of Health leading the efforts and supported by WHO and partners. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead to enhance outbreak preparedness (WHO, 2012). The key preparedness efforts in crisis affected populations should entail the following: , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 227
Context 2: Humanitarian crises tend to disrupt existing national disease surveillance platforms for transmitting data. In the same way, crisis-affected populations may have additional public health needs beyond the ones established through the routine IDSR. Flexibility should be exercised to update the existing IDSR/HMIS reporting tools to capture diseases, conditions, and events unique to crisis affected populations. Consequently, the existing IDSR/HMIS paper-based tools and/or electronic reporting platforms should be updated to capture the additional diseases, condition, and public health events that are unique to crisis affected populations. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 191
Context 3: Outbreaks usually create fear in the community. Involvement of several different stakeholders sometimes leads to uncoordinated and duplication of effort. Provision of timely and accurate information through a well-coordinated mechanism is important. , Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1800"
Q1179,Where should outbreak investigations be undertaken during a humanitarian crisis?,"Context 1: The investigations should be undertaken by rapid response teams at national and sub-national levels that have been established as part of the national IDSR framework. In acute and complex emergencies, dedicated and trained teams will be identified to undertake the investigations. The investigations should follow existing IDSR outbreak investigation guidelines that have been adapted to address the unique needs of crisis affected populations. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 260
Context 2: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 83
Context 3: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98"
Q1180,Which thresholds are used in crisis-affected populations for alert and epidemic detection?,"Context 1: The following thresholds are used in crisis affected populations: , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 239
Context 2: In IDSR, there are two types of thresholds used to initiate response: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. These thresholds are normally expressed in terms of the number (or proportion) of cases of a disease and the critical point (threshold) beyond which action must be taken. Trained health care personnel should always determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Statistical tools and methods may be applied to determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Thresholds for alerts and epidemic for epidemic prone diseases, conditions or events are shown in Section 11 of these  3rd Edition of the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 500
Context 3:  10.5.9.1 Alert and epidemic thresholds , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 238"
Q1182,Why is an exit strategy important during the recovery phase of a crisis?,"Context 1: Partner coordination is another key element during an outbreak and event response and is aimed at fostering ownership, effective participation of key players and efficient use of resources. (See annex 7F for the potential partners and stakeholders who can be involved). It establishes routine communication structures among health workers, community and partners. It helps ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. If the national or district level has a Risk Communication and Community Engagement Plan, these would have been addressed in the Plan., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1802
Context 2: Risk communication improves decision making compliance with treatment and required behaviours for preventive actions, promotes transparency and accountability and builds trust with individuals, community leaders, health workers and policy makers. When risk communication is effectively carried out, it promotes the primary public health goal of rapid outbreak containment preventing avoidable death and disease and with the least possible disruption to economies and society. During epidemics and pandemics, and humanitarian crises and natural disasters, effective risk communication allows people most at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address people’s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant, trusted and acceptable. It is critical that risk communication is not only targeted at outbreak response, risk communication plans should include activities before, during and after the outbreak, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1581
Context 3: This creates trust in the response, in the response teams and increases the likelihood that they follow the advice that is given. Trust is now considered the most important requirement for effective risk communication., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 1708"
Q1184,What is the main objective of an outbreak investigation in the context of IDSR during a humanitarian crisis?,"Context 1: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs., Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 83
Context 2: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 98
Context 3: The investigations should be undertaken by rapid response teams at national and sub-national levels that have been established as part of the national IDSR framework. In acute and complex emergencies, dedicated and trained teams will be identified to undertake the investigations. The investigations should follow existing IDSR outbreak investigation guidelines that have been adapted to address the unique needs of crisis affected populations. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 260"
Q1186,What additional risks and requirements are involved in outbreak response activities in crisis-affected populations?,"Context 1: The additional risks in crisis affected populations will demand strengthening existing or formation of new multi-sectoral outbreak control teams at national and sub national levels, with roles and responsibilities designated for each team member as set out in the IDSR outbreak response guidelines. Health, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and other relevant cluster partners should support outbreak response activities in crisis affected populations. , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 263
Context 2: Outbreak preparedness is paramount given the heightened risk of disease outbreaks in crisis affected populations. Preparedness efforts should as much as possible be integrated in the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the Ministry of Health leading the efforts and supported by WHO and partners. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead to enhance outbreak preparedness (WHO, 2012). The key preparedness efforts in crisis affected populations should entail the following: , Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 227
Context 3: Coordinate disease surveillance and outbreak response in crisis-affected populations;, Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 138"
Q1187,How should countries approach the exit strategy during the recovery phase of a crisis?,"Context 1: Disaster Risk Management Strategy: A strategy for the Health Sector in the African Region. AFR/RC62/6 (2012-2022), Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 678

Context 3: During an emergency or outbreak response, cross-border coordination should include: , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 668"
Q1193,What are indicators and how are they used in measuring the performance of a surveillance system?,"Context 1: Indicators are also used to assess the performance of surveillance system whether it is reaching its targets and objectives. For example, a district may have a goal of reaching 100% completeness of reporting by a certain period. An indicator can be developed to measure the proportion or percentage of facilities that are reporting. This proportion is then compared with the desired goal or target, and can be used to evaluate progress and, therefore, the quality of the service or activity. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 138
Context 2: Using indicators can be helpful in measuring the extent of achievement for a particular program or activity. Indicators are signs of progress – they are used to determine whether the programme/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goal. This achievement is then compared to overall recommended performance standard. Some disease specific surveillance indicators also exist and can be used to monitor quality of the surveillance system e.g. AFP and measles. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 137
Context 3: What are the common methods of indicator-based surveillance?, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 79"
Q1195,How do the selected data for measuring indicators assist in improving the surveillance system?,"Context 1: Strengthening indicator based surveillance with better analysis, reporting and use of routine data for decision making, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 222
Context 2: The purpose of evaluation of a surveillance system is to assess the effectiveness of the system and response system in terms of timeliness, quality of data, preparedness, case management, overall performance and using the indicators to identify gaps or areas that could be strengthened. A comprehensive evaluation should thus include the surveillance system and if already available the IDSR Implementation Plan. The evaluation of the surveillance system should: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 342
Context 3: Use indicators according to national goals and specific plans to improve IDSR activities in a district. Select the indicators that are most relevant to the district’s plan for improving surveillance this year and that will provide information that the district can use. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 140"
Q1197,How does the use of indicators contribute to the overall performance and quality assessment of a surveillance system?,"Context 1: Indicators are also used to assess the performance of surveillance system whether it is reaching its targets and objectives.

Q1199,Where should cases be recorded for surveillance purposes?,"Context 1: Record information of all cases on a “case based surveillance reporting form” (See sample Annex 2F). At least record the following:, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 312
Context 2: Record information about the suspected cases. This information will be used during case investigation activities., Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 440
Context 3: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 81"

Q1201,Who should ensure that cases are identified and reported accurately and promptly for surveillance?,"Context 1: Annex 2F: IDSR immediate Case-Based Surveillance (CBS) Reporting Form, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 689
Context 2: Any suspected event occurring in the community including cases of maternal and neonatal deaths should be reported immediately. The trigger mechanisms of reporting must be clearly defined and the information must be immediately notified to a community focal person, if already identified, or to a nearby health facility. Minimum information collected should include:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 541
Context 3: At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health. , Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 173"
Q1203,What are the examples of indicators for monitoring core surveillance functions at the district level?,"Context 1: ₋          Examples of indicators for this core surveillance function include; , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 163

Q1205,What steps are involved in investigating and confirming suspected cases or outbreaks in the context of IDSR?,"Context 1: Investigation and confirmation of suspected cases, outbreaks or events:, Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 371
Context 2: To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012), Reference: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph: 113
Context 3: This section introduces the concepts of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), which incorporates indicator-based and event-based surveillance as integral parts of an Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS). The section also provides guidance on how IDSR works, the objectives of IDSR, and how IDSR can help to build and sustain the International Health Regulation (IHR) core capacities, thereby facilitating the implementation of IHR.  Furthermore, this section introduces other aspects such as; the One Health approach; the linkage between Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and IDSR; the core surveillance functions; how sub-national levels (for example districts) can use these guidelines to strengthen surveillance and response; the roles and responsibilities of the various actors at different levels; and finally, the priority diseases, conditions and events recommended in Malawi IDSR. , Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 69"
Q1206,How does the monitoring of preparedness for epidemics contribute to the overall effectiveness of IDSR at the district level?,"Context 1: At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format., Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 559

Q1207,What are the components of an effective feedback system in the context of IDSR at the district level?,"Context 1: Districts can also use a matrix of IDSR functions and skills to describe their role in the surveillance system. Such a matrix describes a complete system in which all the skills and activities are in place. Each level supports activities at other levels and reinforces the opportunity for successful decision-making at corresponding levels and functions. In an IDSR system under development, the matrix provides a systematic framework for improving and strengthening the system., Reference: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph: 202

Q1209,Where can tools for evaluating the quality of surveillance systems be found?,"Context 1: Table 8.2: Summary of other attributes for assessing quality of surveillance system , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 249
Context 2: Periodically the quality of the surveillance system should be assessed based on these attributes. Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 210
Context 3: The quality of the surveillance system is defined by attributes such as: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 198"

Context 2: 8.3.1 Monitoring the timeliness and completeness of monthly reporting , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 211
Context 3: If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to: , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 222"
Q1213,What are the consequences of incomplete or late reporting in the context of IDSR?,"Context 1: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. , Reference: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph: 212
Context 2: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak, Reference: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph: 390
Context 3: This section describes how to report priority diseases, conditions and events within the required timelines. In IDSR, data collection and data reporting follow different timeliness for different purposes:, Reference: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph: 487"
