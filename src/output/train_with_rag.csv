Q829,"Compare the laboratory confirmation methods for Chikungunya and diabetes, and which diseases are diagnosed through blood glucose measurements?","Chikungunya is confirmed using serological tests and PCR, while diabetes diagnosis involves blood glucose measurements.",TG Booklet 6,"154, 166",Laboratory Confirmation For Chikungunya Vs. Diabetes,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths. Report summary totals monthly.  During outbreak, count cases and deaths weekly. Analyse by age. Assess risk factors to improve     prevention of outbreaks.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Chikungunya﷐Diagnostic test﷐Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus; the virus may be isolated from the blood of acutely ill patients in newborn mice, mosquitoes or cell culture or detected using IFA or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case (s).

Q464,"Which key information should be recorded during a register review about suspected cases, and how is this information utilized in the subsequent investigation activities?","During a register review, key information about suspected cases should be recorded, including patient details, signs and symptoms, date of onset, outcome, and immunization status. This information serves as a basis for case investigation activities. The recorded data contributes to the line-listing of suspected cases, which is crucial for analyzing outbreak patterns, identifying risk factors, and guiding further investigations and responses.",TG Booklet 3,439-440,"Register Review, Key Information, Suspected Cases, Patient Details, Signs, Symptoms, Onset, Outcome, Immunization Status","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 421, Content: The purpose of a register review is to collect information on cases admitted to the health facility during a specific period.

Q449,Why is the District log of suspected outbreaks and alerts designed to include information about response activities and steps taken during an outbreak?,"The log includes information about response activities and steps taken to provide a comprehensive overview of the outbreak response. Documenting these details is essential for understanding the effectiveness of interventions, identifying gaps or challenges in the response process, and improving future outbreak management strategies. The log serves as a valuable resource for evaluating the overall response and making informed decisions for ongoing and future outbreak preparedness and response efforts.",TG Booklet 3,412,"District Log, Response Activities, Steps Taken, Outbreak, Comprehensive Overview, Effectiveness, Gaps, Challenges, Improvement Strategies","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 214, Content: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution.

Q6,What do Community based surveillance strategies focus on?,"Community-based surveillance strategies focus on two main approaches: the identification and reporting of events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions) by trained community members, and the reporting of unusual events (alerts) that may indicate the early stages of outbreaks. The first approach involves standardized reporting to designated focal points like Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), while the second relies on triaging and verifying information from alerts, often reported by community volunteers. Both approaches actively engage the community in surveillance, utilizing local knowledge for early detection and response to public health events.",TG Booklet 1,86,"Community-based Surveillance Strategies, Identification, Reporting, Agreed Indicators, Lay Case Definitions, Trained Community Members, Triaging, Verifying, Early Detection, Response.","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 86, Content: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 119, Content: Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 431, Content: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event."
Q451,Compare and contrast the District log of suspected outbreaks and alerts with the laboratory supplies checklist in terms of their purposes and contents.,"The District log (Annex 4A) focuses on recording information about suspected outbreaks, alerts, or unexplained events, including disease details, cases, deaths, and response activities. In contrast, the laboratory supplies checklist (Annex 4B) provides a list of items required for safe specimen collection, handling, and transportation during an outbreak investigation. While the log captures epidemiological data, the checklist emphasizes equipment and materials needed for laboratory testing. Both documents contribute to effective outbreak response by providing systematic records and ensuring preparedness.",TG Booklet 3,"411, 414","District Log, Laboratory Supplies Checklist, Purposes, Contents, Epidemiological Data, Equipment, Outbreak Response","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 215, Content: A sample form for tracking reports of outbreaks and rumours is in Annex 4A of this section.

The district rapid response team should then immediately prepare an outbreak investigation report. This detailed report of the outbreak investigation should be prepared and disseminated immediately to the health facility where the outbreak occurred, district, national and also WHO. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1857, Content: After an outbreak or event response has taken place, district staff who led the investigation should prepare a report. The purpose of the report is to document how the problem was identified, investigated, responded to, what the outcome was, decision taken and recommendations made. Make sure that the health unit that reported the initial cases receives a copy of the report. See Annex 7B and Annex 7D at the end of this section for an example of a recommended format and sample."
Q113,How should the One Health approach be implemented to improve reporting of public health risks?,"Emphasize the implementation of the One Health approach to improve reporting of public health risks across all levels, with a focus on strengthening technical and community capacities for all relevant sectors, including human physicians/nurses, veterinarians, and environmental inspectors.",TG Booklet 2,652,"One Health Approach Implementation, Reporting, Technical And Community Capacities","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 652, Content: Ensure implementation of the One Health approach to improve reporting of public health risks across all levels, with emphasis also at the community level.  Emphasize on strengthening the technical and community capacities of staff for all relevant sectors (including human physicians/nurses, veterinarians (for livestock or wildlife) and environmental inspectors. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 162, Content: One Health aims at applying a holistic approach in jointly detecting events and conducting risk assessment in responding to possible public health events occurring at the human-animal-environment interface. Detection of events under the One Health approach thus require all levels from community, district, region and national to strengthen collaboration across sectors, and jointly share responsibility of detecting events which might have impact to the health of humans, and their shared environment.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 151, Content: The One Health approach is intrinsic to and strongly reinforced by WHO’s IHR (2005) and the IDSR strategy as well as other global health frameworks. The One Health approach applies toward improving indicator and event-based surveillance, which is cornerstone for the early warning function of the IDSR. Animal and human health workers as well as other relevant partners should be engaged at various levels to be information sources for IDSR to further facilitate information sharing and joint rapid response activities.  The One Health approach offers a comprehensive framework for IHR (2005) implementation, helping to address Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of all sources. The key principles of the One Health approach include prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases (reference to internationally adopted standards i.e. IHR (2005) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) international standards), and support for national public health services and build on the existing structures.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 809, Content: Analysing data by place provides insight about where a disease is occurring. Establishing and regularly updating a spot map of cases for selected diseases can give ideas as to where, how, and why the disease is spreading. The dot density will give the total number of cases per defined geographic area.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 814, Content: Use manual methods or open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, such as Health Mapper, QGIS, or Geographic Information Software (GIS) to create maps to use as part of routine analysis of disease surveillance of data.

Q1190,Which disease-specific surveillance indicators exist and can be used to monitor the quality of the surveillance system?,Disease-specific surveillance indicators such as AFP and measles exist and can be used to monitor the quality of the surveillance system.,TG Booklet 4,137,"Disease-specific, Surveillance Indicators, AFP, Measles, Quality, Surveillance System","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: Using indicators can be helpful in measuring the extent of achievement for a particular program or activity. Indicators are signs of progress – they are used to determine whether the programme/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goal. This achievement is then compared to overall recommended performance standard. Some disease specific surveillance indicators also exist and can be used to monitor quality of the surveillance system e.g. AFP and measles. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 78, Content: Indicator-based surveillance is the systematic (regular) identification, collection, monitoring, analysis and interpretation of structured data, such as indicators produced by a number of well-identified, mostly health facility-based, formal sources.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Syndromic surveillance: An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or ""rash illness"" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels. "
Q1224,How can the timeliness of reporting be monitored and assessed at the district level?,"The timeliness of reporting can be monitored and assessed by recording and reviewing the dates on which reports are received, measuring how many reporting units submitted reports against the number expected to report, and ensuring deadlines are set for each level to enable effective monitoring.",TG Booklet 4,221-226,"Timeliness, Reporting, Monitoring, Assessment, District Level, Reports Received, Reporting Units, Deadlines, Effective Monitoring","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 222, Content: If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to: 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 932, Content: Monitoring whether surveillance reports are received on time and if all reporting sites have reported is an essential first step in the routine analysis of the surveillance system. This assists the district (or other level) surveillance team in identifying silent areas (areas where health events may be occurring but which are not being reported) or reporting sites that need assistance in transmitting their reports. It also depicts how representative the data is for the specific level.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 212, Content: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. "
Q1162,How do the responsibilities of public and partner-supported health facilities or clinics differ from those at the central/national level in crisis situations?,"Health facilities or clinics focus on detecting, collecting, and reporting priority diseases, supporting the verification and investigation of outbreaks, and implementing response measures, while the central/national level focuses on overall coordination and support.",TG Booklet 5,"127-128, 143-147","Responsibilities, Public Health Facilities, Clinics, Central/national Level, Crisis Situations, Disease Detection, Reporting, Verification, Investigation, Outbreaks, Response Measures, Coordination, Support","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations.

The stakeholders have vital roles on community engagement to support in the delivery of community health in the country and in turn engage with their communities on uptake of these services. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 522, Content: Having a centre for command and control is essential for preparedness and response to public health events. If resources allow, districts will need to have PHEOCs, with basic facilities that support direct coordination of preparedness and response to public health emergencies and facilitate real time communication and information between various stakeholders at their levels, but also ensuring there is a mechanism of sharing information with the national level PHEOC. At district level, the PHERRT performs the roles of PHEOC.  "
Q468,Compare the purposes and criteria for conducting a register review with those of the District log of suspected outbreaks and alerts.,"The register review (Annex 4D) is conducted specifically to collect information on cases admitted to health facilities, focusing on determining the cause of outbreaks or increases in cases. In contrast, the District log (Annex 4A) records suspected outbreaks, alerts, or unexplained events, including initial cases, deaths, and response activities.

Q783,"Where do large outbreaks of Bacterial Meningitis occur, and how do they differ from smaller outbreaks outside the meningitis belt?","Large outbreaks of Bacterial Meningitis occur in the African meningitis belt during the dry season, with smaller outbreaks occurring year-round outside the belt. The text does not specify the geographical locations where smaller outbreaks outside the belt occur.",TG Booklet 6,142,Outbreak Locations: Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 888, Content: In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response. For example, the epidemic threshold for bacterial meningitis in countries of the meningitis belt is 10 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 5 suspected cases in one week or doubling of the number of cases in a three-week period (Minimum of 2 cases in one week), and the alert threshold is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 2 suspected cases per week or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record No 51/52, 577-588, 19 December 2014( http://www.who.int/wer).

Q1149,What steps are involved in implementing IDSR in humanitarian emergencies?,"Steps include rapid assessment of the situation, gap analysis, prioritization based on the results of gap analysis and list of priority events, development of a plan of action at national, intermediate, and local levels, and establishing a coordination mechanism.",TG Booklet 5,115-124,"Implementing IDSR, Humanitarian Emergencies, Rapid Assessment, Gap Analysis, Prioritization, Plan Of Action, Coordination Mechanism","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 84, Content: In these settings, an Enhanced IDSR system should be established to address the humanitarian emergency. The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 85, Content:  This section introduces key principles of implementing IDSR in complex humanitarian emergencies. This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance, (WHO, 2014).
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). "

Q1137,What are the criteria for prioritizing health problems during the emergency phase?,"Prioritized health problems during the emergency phase are based on the increased vulnerability of populations to morbidity, mortality, and disability from endemic and epidemic-prone diseases, requiring a tailored IDSR focusing on diseases, conditions, or events specific to the given emergency context.",TG Booklet 5,98-99,"Prioritizing Health Problems, Emergency Phase, Vulnerability, Morbidity, Mortality, Disability, Endemic Diseases, Epidemic-prone Diseases, Tailored IDSR","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 150, Content: During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).

This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.

This means that, specific information about that suspected case or if it is a cluster, specific information of each of cases identified, will be collected thoroughly and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at PoE, information is reported to the next level (district where the PoE is situated) as well as simultaneously to the IHR NFP.

Q21,What is the role of community networks in Community Based Surveillance (CBS)?,"Community networks are made up of key informants that support the VHCs in early detection of alerts, for example sensitizing the men and women that often visit the grain milling or tea drinking places.",TG Booklet 1,442,"Community Networks, Key Informants, Early Detection Of Alerts, Sensitizing, Grain Milling, Tea Drinking Places.","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 431, Content: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 86, Content: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 439, Content: A crucial step in establishing the Community Based Surveillance is to ensure there is a buy in of both the national and subnational level authorities. This will enable the CBS system to be recognized formally as part of the National Surveillance System and designated people will then be appointed. A designated health facility manager or surveillance officer responsible for coordinating CBS activities should therefore: "
Q893,"What are the surveillance goals for lymphatic filariasis, and how can they be implemented at the local and international levels?","Surveillance goals involve routine monthly reporting, sentinel population surveys, and active case-finding. International reporting is annual. These aim to monitor and reduce transmission, treating disability-related issues",TG Booklet 6,203204,"Surveillance Goals, Lymphatic Filariasis, Routine Reporting, Sentinel Surveys, Active Case-finding, International Reporting, Transmission Reduction, Disability-related Treatment","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 203, Content: Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occurTreatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timoriModes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.Clinical description:Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).Chronic complications include:Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbsDamage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central levelSentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded.Confirmed case:A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case managementHygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis:Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and waterRaising the affected limb at nightExercising to promote lymph flowKeeping nails short and cleanWearing comfortable footwearUsing antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics.For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed:In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose.In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision.The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 yearsAreas with no concurrent OnchocerciasisDiethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, orDiethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administrationAnalyse the drug coverage in implementation unitsAssess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smearFilarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

Q906,"What are the underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths globally, including 35% of the disease burden in children under 5 years?",Maternal and child under-nutrition,TG Booklet 6,220,"Global Deaths, Disease Burden, Children Under 5 Years, Maternal, Child Under-nutrition","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 424, Content: Food and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing approximately 1.8 million people annually, most of whom are children.

Some performance indicators listed below (table 8.3), are examples of indicators for community based surveillance. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 316, Content: In most cases, health facilities and districts reliably report surveillance data to the next level as required. When the district or national managers receive data, they should respond to the health facilities that reported it. The purpose of the feedback is to reinforce health workers’ effort to participate in the surveillance system. Another purpose is to raise awareness about certain diseases and any achievements of disease control and prevention projects in the area. Feedback is classified as supportive when it reinforces and acknowledges good performance and corrective when a change in behaviour and improvement is required. It also strengthens the communication and spirit of team working. The feedback should be both vertical and horizontal targeting at different audiences as provided by different levels in the health system. Effective feedback should be; "

Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes

Q955,"What factors may lead to severe illness from measles, especially in children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition?","Measles may result in severe illness, especially in children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia.",TG Booklet 6,226,"Severe Illness, Measles, Vitamin A Deficiency, Malnutrition, Virus, Bacterial Infections, Pneumonia","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible.Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is confirmed:Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage.Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths.

Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead in coordinating and implementing outbreak response activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 191, Content: Humanitarian crises tend to disrupt existing national disease surveillance platforms for transmitting data. In the same way, crisis-affected populations may have additional public health needs beyond the ones established through the routine IDSR. Flexibility should be exercised to update the existing IDSR/HMIS reporting tools to capture diseases, conditions, and events unique to crisis affected populations. Consequently, the existing IDSR/HMIS paper-based tools and/or electronic reporting platforms should be updated to capture the additional diseases, condition, and public health events that are unique to crisis affected populations.

Q1223,What are the important aspects of timelines of reporting in a communicable disease surveillance system?,"Important aspects of timeliness of reporting include timeliness of immediate notification (within 24 hours), timeliness of weekly reporting, and timeliness of monthly reporting.",TG Booklet 4,214-217,"Important Aspects, Timeliness, Reporting, Communicable Disease Surveillance System, Immediate Notification, Weekly Reporting, Monthly Reporting","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 121, Content: Surveillance priorities may be communicable and non-communicable diseases, conditions, or events that include national or local priorities such as acute outbreaks and deaths or events associated with human and/or animal health events which might have direct consequences to human health. An essential function of a public health surveillance system is to be vigilant in its capacity to detect not only known public health threats with established case definitions and formal reporting channels but also events or hazards that are not explicitly included in the formal reporting system. These may be events such as clusters of disease patterns or rumours of unexplained deaths.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Other intervals to monitor for detection of immediately reportable diseases include monitoring reporting from the community to the health facility and to the district (within 24 hours of onset of illness), from the health facility to the district (within 24 hours) and from the time the threshold is reached to a concrete response (within 48 hours). 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: Provide clear information to frontline staff about Why report unusual events? What events are reportable? How to report an unusual event? What happens after you report? Examples of event reporting:Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal. Detect cases. Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks."
Q312,What is the purpose of an outbreak investigation?,"The purpose of an outbreak investigation is to verify the outbreak or public health event and risk, identify and treat additional cases, collect information and specimens for confirming the diagnosis, identify the source of infection or cause of the outbreak, describe the epidemiological situation, and select appropriate response activities.",TG Booklet 3,177-187,"Outbreak Investigation, Purpose, Verify, Treat Cases, Collect Information, Diagnose, Source Identification, Epidemiological Situation, Response Activities","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities."
Q757,"When should specimens be collected for BU confirmation, and why is it essential to collect them before antibiotic treatment?",Specimens should be collected from suspected patients before any antibiotic is given to ensure accurate confirmation.

Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.

Q1188,When should indicators be used to measure the extent of achievement for a program or activity?,Indicators should be used throughout the program or activity to measure the extent of achievement and to determine whether the program/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goals.,TG Booklet 4,137,"Indicators, Measurement, Achievement, Program, Activity, Objectives, Goals","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: Using indicators can be helpful in measuring the extent of achievement for a particular program or activity. Indicators are signs of progress – they are used to determine whether the programme/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goal. This achievement is then compared to overall recommended performance standard. Some disease specific surveillance indicators also exist and can be used to monitor quality of the surveillance system e.g. AFP and measles. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 138, Content: Indicators are also used to assess the performance of surveillance system whether it is reaching its targets and objectives. For example, a district may have a goal of reaching 100% completeness of reporting by a certain period. An indicator can be developed to measure the proportion or percentage of facilities that are reporting. This proportion is then compared with the desired goal or target, and can be used to evaluate progress and, therefore, the quality of the service or activity. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 222, Content: If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to: "
Q872,What is the reference for guidelines on investigating and controlling foodborne disease outbreaks?,The reference for guidelines on investigating and controlling foodborne disease outbreaks is WHO Foodborne disease outbreaks: Guidelines for investigation and control. It can be accessed at this link.,TG Booklet 6,186,"Foodborne Disease Outbreak Guidelines, WHO, Investigation, Control","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 186, Content: Background﷐Foodborne illnesses are caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal pathogens or their toxins that enter the body through consumption of food or water. In addition to diseases listed elsewhere in this guideline such as cholera, and shigellosis, surveillance for foodborne illnesses may involve other causes such as salmonellosis, hepatitis A or chemical contamination.A foodborne illness occurs when two or more people have shared common food or drink followed by an onset of symptoms within a short time period.Most people with a foodborne illness do not seek medical care, so cases and outbreaks of foodborne illness usually are neither recognized nor reported.The first symptoms often occur in gastrointestinal tract. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea are frequent symptoms of foodborne diseases.Outbreaks may be localized affecting as few as 2 individuals who ate a common meal or product, but large and geographically widespread outbreaks may also occur. Large outbreaks occur when food is contaminated prior to distribution and is widely consumed by many people in many areas.Surveillance for foodborne illnesses is needed to monitor food safety and target health promotion actions aimed at food handlers for safer food practices and improved personal hygiene.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐To promptly identify any unusual cluster of disease potentially transmitted through food, which may need a public health investigation or response.Monitor the magnitude of foodborne illnessesIdentify high risk foods or food practices.Monitor risk factors to inform public health interventions and health promotion for targeted foods or food practices.﷐Standard case definition: Foodborne illness﷐A foodborne illness is suspected when 2 or more people present with similar symptoms and who consumed common food or drinkA foodborne illness is defined according to the specific agent causing the disease (for example, cholera, hepatitis A, salmonellosis, shigellosis).A confirmed foodborne illness is a laboratory confirmed case of a specific agent with a link to a common food or drink source.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Foodborne illness﷐If observed that ≥2 people are ill and have eaten food from a common source:Immediately report the illness to the next level of the heath systemFrom patients and from the suspected food items and drinks, collect specimens for laboratory confirmationTreat suspected cases﷐Respond to action threshold: Foodborne illness﷐If an outbreak of a foodborne illness is confirmed:Search for additional cases in locality of confirmed casesStrengthen case management and treatmentMobilise community for rapid case detection and treatmentIdentify high risk groupsRemove from the restaurant menu or the supermarkets shelves, food items from which evidence of unsafe food may be obtained.Eventually call for in-depth investigation of the food chains that may be associated with the outbreakReduce sporadic and outbreak-related cases by promoting handwashing with soap and water after defecating/urinating and before food handling/meals; strengthen access to safe water supply and storage, use of latrines and safe human waste disposalScale-up food safety health promotion activities using the WHO Five Keys to Safer Food (see reference below) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systemScale-up food inspection activities﷐Analyse and interpret data: Foodborne illness﷐Time: Graph monthly trends in cases and deaths; Construct an epidemic curve for outbreak cases.Place: Plot location of households for cases and deathsPerson: Count cases and deaths each month.

Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 70, Content: It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 221, Content: The previous edition of these guidelines have been revised in order to incorporate lessons learnt from previous epidemics, new frameworks or strategies such the regional strategy for health security and emergencies, the revised IHR monitoring and evaluation framework, the initiatives for enhancing prevention, detection and response to public health events (Global Health Security Agenda, One Health, DRM), key regional strategies and rising non-communicable disease threats and road traffic injuries in the context development of resilient health systems. The revised guidelines also aim to address how to implement the IHR (2005) requirements and capacities for surveillance and response. These guidelines have been adapted to reflect Malawi’s national priorities, policies and public health structures; and will be used in conjunction with other similar guidelines/strategies or initiatives. Overall, the revised guidelines will incorporate the following: "
Q469,What information should the health facility registers ideally include for investigating suspected cases during a register review?,"The health facility registers should ideally include the patient’s name and location, signs and symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, outcome (e.g., date of death), and immunization status if appropriate to the disease. This information is crucial for investigating suspected cases and responding to outbreaks effectively. If the registers lack essential information, discussions with senior staff should focus on strengthening record-keeping practices to ensure the necessary data is collected.",TG Booklet 3,431-436,"Health Facility Registers, Investigating Suspected Cases, Patient Information, Signs, Symptoms, Onset Date, Outcome, Immunization Status","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 421, Content: The purpose of a register review is to collect information on cases admitted to the health facility during a specific period.

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 438, Content: Go to the selected wards as scheduled. During the visit, look in the health facility registers for cases and deaths that may be suspected cases of a priority disease. These should be cases or deaths that meet the standard case definition for suspected cases. Find out whether the suspected case was investigated and reported according to the national guidelines.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 304, Content: In the health facilities where cases have been reported, search for additional suspected cases and deaths in the registers. Look for other patients who may have presented with the same or similar signs and symptoms as the disease or condition being investigated. The team should request health workers to search for similar cases in the neighbouring health facilities and in health facilities where the person may have passed there during travelling."
Q1061,"What is the global incidence of tuberculosis, and which population groups are at the highest risk of dying from tuberculosis?","Tuberculosis has over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year globally. The highest-risk groups include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and other immunocompromising conditions, the very young, and the very old.",TG Booklet 6,286,"Global Incidence, Tuberculosis, High-risk Populations","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 286, Content: Background﷐Infection of the lungs and other organs usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmitted person-to-person by droplet infection through coughing, sneezing or spitting. Clinically, the pulmonary form of the disease is more common than the extra-pulmonary form. The cardinal symptoms of pulmonary TB are chronic cough, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite and night sweats.Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious illness and death worldwide with over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year. In African countries, approximately 1.6 million of the new cases and over 600 000 cases occur each year. It is also estimated that between 30 and 50% of all new TB cases detected are infected with HIV and 40% of all AIDS deaths are due to TB. Those who are at highest risk of dying from TB include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and other immuno-compromising conditions, the very young, and the very old.The global HIV pandemic has been a major cause of increasing TB cases, especially in African countries.Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months.WHO recommends the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy to maximize compliance and treatment efficacy and to reduce development of drug-resistant strains. The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region. Varying degrees of success have been achieved in controlling TB where resources and motivation for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow up are adequate.Clinically, bacterial pneumonia, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS and a variety of other bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes of fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, or may themselves precipitate active TB in an already infected individual. Abdominal or other extra-pulmonary sites of infection may occur after ingestion of un-pasteurized cow’s milk (M. bovis).﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of persons with infectious lung disease to improve chances of clinical improvement and reduce transmission of TB.Improve percentage of TB cases confirmed by microscope
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 269, Content: Background﷐Severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc.An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics.To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with:history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°;and cough;with onset within the last 10 days;and requires hospitalization.﷐Respond to an alert threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Describe possible exposures.Person: For individual SARI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data, and for tracking patient if necessary), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of hospitalization (SARI patients only), Patient outcome (death, survival), Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on SARI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting. Recommended major age groupings for analysing are: 0 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <15 years, 15 to <50 years, 50 to <65 years, ≥ 65 years.For the laboratory data, as a minimum, it is recommended that the following data should be collected:• The number of samples tested for influenza during the week.• The proportion of samples that were positive for influenza for SARI • Types and subtypes of viruses detected during the week.• Results from antiviral resistance testing (if applicable).At the end, the following indicators or aggregated data should be collected and reported from each sentinel site:The number of new SARI cases from whom specimens were collected during the week, grouped by standard age groups, and the proportion of each of these that were positive for influenza.The total number of new SARI cases reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups (this includes cases that were not tested and/or did not have detailed data collected).The number of total new hospital admissions reported during the week in the sentinel hospital where SARI surveillance is being conducted, ideally grouped by the recommended age groups.The number of SARI deaths occurring in the healthcare facility sentinel site reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups.The proportion of cases having each of the chronic pre-existing medical illnesses for influenza positive SARI cases, reported separately.Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/AFRGeneric protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance: https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance ﷐Laboratory testing: Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs)﷐ 1- For the influenza virus:Specimens can be positive seven days or more after the onset of illness but ability to detect virus drops off notably after five to seven days, depending on the test used.Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method for detecting influenza virus and is the recommended influenza surveillance assay for most laboratories.Virus culture is also needed on at least a subset of specimens in order to allow detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of the virus.Antiviral resistance testing should be considered for high-risk patients if capacity exists in the laboratory in addition to taking a sample from non-high-risk patientsFurther technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011. https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/manual_diagnosis_surveillance_influenza/en/2- For others virus, and pathogens,please consult pathogens specific WHO guidances﷐References﷐WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible.Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is confirmed:Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage.Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths.

Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 380, Content: At some point, during the outbreak setting, public health response might include also testing new potential countermeasures including vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, the conduct of biomedical research can be an important and discrete component of the response. Public health efforts must always remain at the forefront of the overall outbreak response. The research must be conducted in a scientifically and ethically sound manner to reach definitive conclusions about efficacy and safety as expeditiously as possible. It is the role of the National Level to liaise with the Ethical Committees Body within the country to provide a useful guide for analogous principles in outbreak situations in such settings 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 249, Content: With the team, develop terms of reference that define the objectives of the investigation so that the essential information will be gathered for investigating the outbreak and implementing the most appropriate and relevant response. Discuss also, who are the stakeholders or parties involved. The national level may deploy a team to support the districts to investigate and respond to the outbreak/public health emergency as per the national policy. This includes standard guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)/methods that are relevant to the disease or condition being investigated (for example, SOP for collecting the correct laboratory specimen, case management guidelines, case investigation forms, line-listing forms) – refer to the existing documents/ guidelines for the specific condition/event."
Q157,What types of sites are considered reporting sites in the context of surveillance?,"Reporting sites include health facilities (public, private, quasi-governmental, faith-based), standalone laboratories, and Points of Entry (PoE).",TG Booklet 2,750,"Reporting Sites, Health Facilities, Laboratories, Points Of Entry (poe)","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 750, Content: The routine flow of surveillance data is usually from reporting sites to the next level up to the central level. A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 932, Content: Monitoring whether surveillance reports are received on time and if all reporting sites have reported is an essential first step in the routine analysis of the surveillance system. This assists the district (or other level) surveillance team in identifying silent areas (areas where health events may be occurring but which are not being reported) or reporting sites that need assistance in transmitting their reports.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 173, Content: At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health.

Sections of the register should include pictures or images of the community case definitions and the predetermined events/signals to assist in detection at the community level."
Q1065,"What are the key symptoms of typhoid fever, and who is the most affected age group?","Key symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhea, rose-colored spots, and enlarged spleen and liver. The most affected age group is children from 5–19 years old.",TG Booklet 6,289,"Typhoid Fever Symptoms, Affected Age Group","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 289, Content: Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness.Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually. In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers.Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection.Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries.People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months.Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verificationIdentify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures﷐Standard case definitions﷐Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea.Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool.

Search for case/carrier that is the source of infection and for the vehicle (water or food) through which infection is being transmitted.Treat typhoid fever patients with antibiotics. Severe cases should be provided supportive measures such as oral or intravenous hydration, the use of antipyretics, and appropriate nutrition.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Typhoid Fever cases are confirmedInitiate a line list/register for casesIdentify areas/populations at high risk to identify source(s) and mode(s) of transmission in order to prevent and control the disease.Conduct health education programmes on hygiene with simple messages on safe water, safe food handling practices, hygiene and handwashing.Work with water authorities to support provision of clean water and proper sanitation to affected population(s). Chlorinate suspected water supplies. All drinking water should be chlorinated or boiled before use.More than 90% of patients can be managed at home with oral antibiotics, reliable care and close medical follow-up for complications or failure to respond to therapy. Patients with persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea and abdominal distension may require hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic therapy.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly.

Suspected caseA person presenting a skin lesion with itching or blister living in an endemic area or risk areas for Guinea worm, with the emergence of a worm. Confirmed caseA case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm, and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 175, Content:  Background﷐Dracunculiasis is commonly known as Guinea worm disease. It is caused by a large nematode, a disabling parasite that emerges through the skin of the infected person.This is an old disease, known since antiquity, inflicting an excruciating pain on affected individuals and usually causing temporary disability, leaving many patients with unfortunate socio-economic consequences. It is transmitted through ingestion of water containing a crustacean (cyclops) which is infested by an immature form (larvae) of the nematode. The Cyclops is found in stagnant surface water sources (ponds, traditional shallow wells). The female nematode discharges larvae from the host’s skin when there is contact with water. The incubation period is usually between 10 to 14 months. There is no treatment or vaccine against the disease.Successful disease elimination strategies conducted by the endemic countries and an international coalition of partners has pushed Dracunculiasis towards eradication. During 2017, only 30 cases of Guinea worm disease worldwide were reported to WHO, compared to 892 000 in 1989, showing a reduction of 99.99%.In 1989, the disease was endemic in 20 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Togo, Uganda and Yemen.Africa remains the only affected continent, with 5 countries having reported infection emanating from indigenous transmission of the parasite either in human and/or in animal in 2018: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.Since, 2012, emerging worms from animals, mostly dogs, and in a few instances, cats and baboons, have been reported in some of the remaining endemic countries and confirmed in the WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for Dracunculiasis Eradication laboratory, as Dracunculus medinensis. Accordingly, dracunculiasis eradication, which was previously based on interrupting transmission in human, will now include interrupting transmission in both human and animal hosts.2

Since 2017, full oral combined antibiotics (rifampicin and clarithromycin) are now recommended for treatment of cases with wound care of ulcers. Surgery is still needed for late cases (category III). Cumulative number of cases in the WHO African Region that is the most affected (95% of global cases) is around 90,000 in 2017.Mode of transmission is still unknown. M ulcerans could penetrate the skin through insect bite (water bugs); micro trauma or small woundsConfirmation of diagnosis is done by PCR, AFB search with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, culture or histology. Specimens of lesions are taken by swab in ulcer, fine needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy in case of surgery. New diagnostic tests based of the presence of mycolactone, a toxin released by M ulcerans in lesions, are under development.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Geographical distribution of the disease to locate endemic areas and districts and focus early case finding, proper management with WHO recommended antibiotics and prevention of disabilities﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A person presenting a painless skin nodule, plaque or ulcer, living or having visited a BU endemic areaConfirmed case: A suspected case confirmed by at least one laboratory test (ZN for AFB, PCR, culture or histology).

Q397,What channels of communication are described in Section 7 for reporting outbreak findings?,Section 7 describes various channels of communication during an outbreak for reporting findings.,TG Booklet 3,365,"Communication Channels, Reporting Outbreak Findings, Section 7","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1807, Content: Communication with affected communities and stakeholders, including the media is essential during outbreak and event response. Thus, establishing routine communication structures and processes between the health and community partners helps to ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. Options for communicating between the various partners can range from press releases, press conferences, television and radio messages, meetings (health personnel, community, religious, opinion and political leaders); Educational and communication materials (posters, fliers); Multi-media presentations (for example, films, video or narrated slide presentations) at the markets, health centres, schools, women’s and other community groups, service organizations, religious centres, local community media, Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.), SMS, telephone, hand-carried message, Community drama groups/play group; site visits; fax, email updates and exchanges of communication materials to more formal decision-making committees. Regardless of the mechanism, ensure that the focus is on transparent and trustworthy communication that considers community experiences.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Step 7 – Risk communication: Risk communication is an essential element for all surveillance systems, as well as for disaster and emergency preparedness and response.  It is the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts, community leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. Encourage future cooperation by communicating with all levels including communities that provided data, reported outbreaks, cases and events, about the investigation outcome and success of response efforts. Acknowledge the reporting by communities.

Q63,Why is zero reporting important in disease surveillance?,Zero reporting is essential to communicate that no cases of an immediately reportable disease were diagnosed during the week. It ensures completeness in reporting and informs the staff at the next level that a thorough report has been filled.,TG Booklet 2,565,"Zero Reporting, Immediately Reportable Disease, Completeness, Reporting Sites","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 771, Content: Record a zero when no cases were reported. If a space which should have been filled in is left blank/dash/not applicable, the next level may have an incorrect picture of the situation. They will not know if data are missing or if no cases were reported. Zero reporting allows the next level to know that surveillance did not detect a case of the particular disease or condition.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 566, Content: If no cases of an immediately reportable disease have been diagnosed during the week, record a zero (0) on the reporting form for that disease. If the space is left blank, the staffs that receive the report will not be able to develop information from a blank space. Submitting a zero report for each immediately reportable disease when no cases were detected during the week tells the staff at the next level that a complete report has been filled.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 890, Content: In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system. This facilitates use of surveillance information for action at the level where it is collected. Periodically, surveillance thresholds are assessed and reset at national or international levels according to the observed trends of the diseases, events or conditions under surveillance."
Q995,How is HIV transmitted between humans?,"HIV is transmitted through sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk, or direct contact with infected human body fluids.",TG Booklet 6,239,"HIV Transmission, Sexual Intercourse, Needle Injections, Transfusions, Trans-placental, Trans-vaginal, Breast Milk, Direct Contact, Infected Human Body Fluids","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 239, Content: BackgroundAIDS is an infection of human lymphocytes (types of white blood cells) and other organs. It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human.Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others.Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region.Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years.Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers.Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS).Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted.Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission.Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TBImprove percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.Improve HIV/AIDS screening.﷐Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions. A positive ELISA for confirming HIV and a rapid test for confirming the positive results are sufficient for an epidemiologic case definition for HIV infection.﷐Public health actions﷐Monitor local STI and opportunistic infections, including TB, as possible cofactor for HIV.Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.Monitor use of condoms by commercial sex workers.Provide voluntary counselling and testing services at district and sub-district levels.Treatment of individual cases with antiretroviral therapy is not yet widely available in most African countries. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection (OI) may prolong life expectancy but this has not been widely evaluated in developing countries.Promote condom use, especially among high-risk individuals.Treat STIs, especially syphilis, chancroid diseases, and other ulcerative processes.Mobilize non-paid blood donors and promote appropriate use of blood.Promote good infection control practices within health facilities in the district.Educate patients and their sexual partners to refrain from donating blood, tissues, semen or breast milk.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Count new HIV/AIDS cases and report monthly. Analyse by number of cases confirmed with serology. At the end of the year, calculate the total number of cases and include trends for HIV sero-surveillance, STI surveillance and results of any special studies (socio-behavioural studies, drug sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, and so on).﷐Laboratory confirmation: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐Diagnostic test﷐Adults and children 18 months or older:HIV infection is diagnosed based on:- Positive HIV antibody testing (rapid or laboratory- based enzyme immunoassay). This is confirmed by a second HIV antibody test (rapid or laboratory-based enzyme immunoassay) relying on different antigens or of different operating characteristics; AND/ OR- Positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen assay) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determinationChildren younger than 18 months:HIV infection is diagnosed based on positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determination taken more than four weeks after birth.Positive HIV antibody testing is not recommended for definitive or confirmatory diagnosis of HIV infection in children until 18 months of age.﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Obtain specimens according to national HIV/AIDS program strategy for clinical or epidemiological sampling.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen﷐Use universal precautions to minimize exposure to sharps and any body fluid.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 276, Content: Background﷐Infections of the human genito-urinary and reproductive systems transmitted via human sexual contact (sexually transmitted disease, STIs). The most common causes of male urethral discharge are a) the gonococcus Neisseria gonorrhoea and b) Chlamydia trachomatis. The most common causes of male and female genital ulcer are c) syphilis (Treponema pallidum), d) herpes simplex virus (HSV1 or 2) and e) chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi).STIs are endemic in most countries of the world, including countries in Africa. Multiple simultaneous STIs are common (for example, gonorrhoea plus Chlamydia). STIs may be most highly prevalent in areas where HIV occurs and may facilitate HIV transmission. STIs may be primary or from repeated attacks of urethral discharge.STIs are a leading cause of abortion and stillbirth, prematurity, and congenital infections. They may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of decreased fertility.Incubation periods for gonorrhoea are 2 to 7 days; Chlamydia 7 to 14 days (or longer); syphilis, 10 days to 12 weeks (usually around 3 weeks), and chancroid, 3 to 14 days.STIs may be more commonly diagnosed in men, in whom clinical evidence of infection may be more readily apparent.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection and treatment of STI reduces transmission rates. Active efforts to diagnose latent syphilis may prevent significant disability.Improve early and effective treatment of STIs using simple algorithms based on syndromic diagnosis for index cases and partners.Carry out laboratory-based anti-microbial sensitivity monitoring and modify treatment guidelines accordingly at the national level.Compare surveillance data for both STIs and HIV/AIDS since STIs may reflect co-presence of HIV.﷐Standard case definition﷐Genital ulcer syndrome (non-vesicular):Suspected case: Any male with an ulcer on the penis, scrotum, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy, or any female with ulcer on labia, vagina, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy.Confirmed case: Any suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method.Urethral discharge syndrome:Suspected case: Any male with urethral discharge with or without dysuria.Confirmed case: Urethral discharge syndrome: A suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method (for example Gram stain showing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci).﷐Public health action﷐Conduct active case finding for specific target groups.Conduct primary prevention activities such as promotion of safer sexual behaviours and provision of condoms.Assess use of algorithms for detection and treatment of STIs. And improve health worker practice with algorithms.Include STI prevention and care services in maternal and child health, and family planning services.Target acceptable and effective STI prevention and care services to populations identified as vulnerable to STI transmission.Promote early STI health seeking behaviour.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases each quarter.Place:No recommendation for analysis of place.Person:Count quarterly cases and analyse age distribution.﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Reference﷐Guidelines for Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis."

Every maternal death is considered significant.,TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Death Alert Threshold, Health Facility, Significance Of Each Death","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1578, Content: IDSR strategy is an approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national levels. Since IDSR is a system with the potential to ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements, risk communication should be integrated in all the IDSR core functions and activities particularly detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, response and preparedness. The IDSR core functions and activities for each level of the health system are well illustrated in the Introduction section of this guideline. Effective risk communication is therefore needed to achieve the objectives for IDSR 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 109, Content: The focus is on the creation of an overall public health surveillance system with sufficient capacity for detecting, confirming and responding to diseases, conditions and events. IDSR ensures that the information flow is bi-directional (horizontal and vertical), so that each level is informed of potential outbreaks and response interventions in a timely manner. "
Q1077,Which type of surveillance is case-based surveillance?,Case-based surveillance is the type used for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks.,TG Booklet 1,82,"Case-based Surveillance, Disease Elimination, Disease Eradication, Confirmed Outbreaks","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 81, Content: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 88, Content: Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 94, Content: Unlike indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is not based on the routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action but rather on the screening of ALL available information to detect any event happening in the community (unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual or clustering of cases, events/conditions in the community, including environmental conditions). "
Q814,"What is the goal of diabetes surveillance, and why is it important to estimate the magnitude of the disease?","The goal of diabetes surveillance is to estimate the magnitude of the disease, monitor trends and risk factors, and identify populations at the highest risk. Estimating the magnitude is crucial for planning and implementing effective prevention and control measures.",TG Booklet 6,165,Diabetes Surveillance Goal,"Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 70, Content: It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 101, Content: The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population."
Q874,"What is the surveillance goal for hypertension, and what actions are recommended?","The surveillance goal for hypertension is the prevention of secondary illness through early detection and standardized treatment, estimating disease burden, and reducing identified risk factors. Recommended actions include health promotion for non-communicable diseases, focusing on HBP, community-based education on behavior change and healthy lifestyles, and promoting secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.",TG Booklet 6,188,"Hypertension Surveillance Goal, Secondary Illness Prevention, Early Detection, Standardized Treatment, Disease Burden Estimation, Risk Factor Reduction","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 183, Content: These guidelines assume that all levels of the health system are involved in conducting surveillance activities for detecting and responding to priority diseases, conditions and events (even though the different levels do not perform identical functions). These activities include the following core functions:

Suspected caseA person presenting a skin lesion with itching or blister living in an endemic area or risk areas for Guinea worm, with the emergence of a worm. Confirmed caseA case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm, and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms.

Q971,"What percentage of reported MERS patients have died, and where have the largest outbreaks occurred?","Approximately 35% of reported MERS patients have died. The largest outbreaks have been seen in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea.",TG Booklet 6,228,"MERS Patient Mortality Rate, Largest Outbreaks, Location, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Republic Of Korea","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 228, Content: Background﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death.Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case.Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died.Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Surveillance Goal﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmissionTo determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Standard case definition﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV)A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, who requires admission to hospital, with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation (clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised);AND any of the following:the person resides in the Middle East, in particular where human infections have been reported, and in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels;the patient is part of a cluster of acute respiratory illness that occurs within a 14 day period, without regard to place of residence or history of travel;the disease occurs in a health care worker who has been working in an environment where patients with severe acute respiratory infections are being cared for, without regard to place of residence or history of travel;the person develops an unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment, without regard to place of residence or history of travel, even if another aetiology has been identified that fully explains the clinical presentation.A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, and who has travelled within 14 days before onset of illness to the Middle East2 or countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred.Individuals with acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had any of the following exposures (Note: see section on Recommendations for testing in clusters associated with health care settings): close physical contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection, while that patient was ill;a healthcare facility in a country where hospital-associated MERS-CoV infections have been reported;direct contact with dromedary camels or consumption or exposure to dromedary camel products (raw meat, unpasteurized milk, urine) in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camel populations or where human infections occurred as a result of presumed zoonotic transmission.Countries in the Middle East2 are also strongly encouraged to consider adding testing for MERS-CoV to current testing algorithms as part of routine sentinel respiratory disease surveillance and diagnostic panels for pneumonia.WHO case definitions for MERS-CoV can be found here http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.htmlConfirmed case definitionA person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection,1 irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.Probable case definitionA febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is unavailable, negative on a single inadequate specimen3 or inconclusive4 A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) that cannot be explained fully by any other aetiologyANDThe person resides or travelled in the Middle East, or in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4 An acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4 Notes1 A case may be laboratory confirmed by detection of viral nucleic acid or serology. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/)2 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include:Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Working together in close proximity or sharing the same environment with individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Traveling together with individuals infected with MERS-CoV in any kind of conveyance Living in the same household as individuals infected with MERS-CoV. The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14-day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration. 3 An inadequate specimen would include a nasopharyngeal swab without an accompanying lower respiratory specimen, a specimen that has had improper handling, is judged to be of poor quality by the testing laboratory, or was taken too late in the course of illness.4 Inconclusive tests may include: A positive test by nucleic acid amplification assay for a single target without further  testing.Evidence of sero-reactivity by a single convalescent serum sample ideally taken at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens. Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat nasopharyngeal specimen with additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory tract specimens are not possible, and appropriately timed paired acute and convalescent sera. Other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood/serum, urine and stool. These generally have lower titres of virus than respiratory tract specimens but have been used to confirm cases when other specimens were inadequate or unobtainable. Laboratories which obtain discordant PCR testing results and have limited experience in detecting MERS-CoV should consider referring their specimens to laboratories with greater experience for confirmation.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Refer to the WHO case reporting form (available in English and French)Responding to an alert ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐If a single case/cluster or outbreak is suspected:All health care workers who collect specimens from patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, andStandard and droplet infection control precautions are sufficient when collecting biological samples from suspected patients.Additional precautions are required when aerosol-generating procedures are performed on a patientAll those involved in collection and transporting specimens should be trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination procedures.WHO requests that probable and confirmed cases be reported within 24 hours of classification, through the regional contact point for International Health Regulations at the appropriate WHO regional office. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Proper and respectful burial or cremation (if practiced) of dead bodies (humans)Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to use infection control in the home care setting (see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-infection/en/)Efforts to identify additional cases beyond close contacts are critical for prevention and control of infection, and to determine the total extent of transmission in the community. Active case finding in the area under investigation should focus on:Patients currently admitted to health care facilities in the community where the confirmed MERS-CoV case was discovered. Any patients currently in the hospital with unexplained SARI should be considered for testing for MERS-CoV.Health care providers in the community; health workers should be interviewed about recent cases of unexplained pneumonia and notified to immediately report any patients who have signs and symptoms that meet the case definition developed for the investigation as described above in section 3.4.1. Patients meeting the case definition should be tested for MERS-CoV.Patients who recently died of an unexplained illness consistent with the case definition developed for the investigation should be tested for MERS-CoV infection if appropriate clinical specimens are available.Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases should be identified and monitored for the appearance of respiratory symptoms for 14 days after last exposure to the confirmed or suspected case, while the case was symptomatic. Any contact that becomes ill in that period of time should be tested for MERS-CoV.  If feasible, all contacts especially health care workers and other inpatient hospital contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms should be tested for MERS-CoV.Request additional help from national levels, as needed.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Time: Graphs of number of suspected / probable / confirmed cases by date (epidemic curve).Place: Map of suspected and confirmed human and animal cases by geographical area (district)Person: Table showing the number of suspected / probable / confirmed cases by date, age and sex﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐In this section guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for lab confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.Laboratory guidance for MERS-CoV http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-laboratory/en/index.htmlRecommendations for specimen collectionLower respiratory specimens have a higher diagnostic value than upper respiratory tract specimens for detecting MERS-CoV infection. Upper respiratory tract samples have yielded negative results in some symptomatic close contacts of confirmed cases, who later developed pneumonia and tested positive on lower respiratory specimens. It is WHO has strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage be collected for MERS-CoV testing where possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected. If initial testing is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, the patient should be resampled and specimens collected from multiple respiratory tract sites. Paired acute and convalescent sera for antibody detection should also be collected. Virus has also been demonstrated in body fluids such as blood, urine, and stool, but usually at lower titres than in respiratory tract specimens. Such specimens may be collected when good quality respiratory tract specimens are unavailable, or to monitor the presence of virus in different body compartments.Table 1.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 271, Content: Background﷐Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a global threat in 2003 when international spread resulted in 8,098 SARS cases in 26 countries, with 774 deaths.Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was a striking feature of the SARS outbreak.The majority of the cases were adults. The case fatality ratio of SARS is estimated to range from 0% to more than 50% depending on the age group affected and reporting centre, with a crude global CFR of approximately 9.6%.The mean incubation period is 5 days, with the range of 2-10 days. Patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms including fever, malaise, myalgia, headache and rigors. Cough (initially dry), dyspnoea and diarrhoea may be present in the first week but more commonly reported in the second week of illness. Severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress. Up to 70% of the patients develop diarrhoea.Disease transmission occurs mainly during the second week of illness.The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes SARS is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans recently.In the inter-epidemic period, all countries must remain vigilant for the recurrence of SARS and maintain their ability to detect and respond to the possible re-emergence of SARSImmediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR ( Annex 2, IHR ).﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection and investigation of individuals with clinically apparent SARS-CoV.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case of SARS is an individual with:A history of fever, or documented fever ≥ 38 °C ANDOne or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath) ANDRadiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or ARDS or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause ANDNo alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness.Confirmed case of SARS: An individual who tests positive for SARS-CoV infection by the WHO recommended testing procedures.﷐Respond to suspected case﷐Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.Practice infection control precautions for an acute respiratory disease with epidemic/pandemic potential immediately and enhance Standard Precautions throughout the health care setting.Treat and manage the patient according to national guidelines.Collect and transport laboratory specimens from case-patient and from symptomatic contacts and arrange for laboratory testing.Review clinical history and exposure history during 2-10 days before disease onset.Identify and follow-up close contacts of case-patient.Conduct active searches for additional cases.Expedite the diagnosis.(WHO will assist in the investigation of SARS alerts as appropriate, including facilitating access to laboratory services)﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Response to SARS alert is same as response to suspected case (see above). SARS ALERT:An individual with clinical evidence of SARS AND with an epidemiological risk factor for SARS-CoV infection in the 10 days before the onset of symptoms ORTwo or more health-care workers with clinical evidence of SARS in the same health-care unit and with onset of illness in the same 10-day period ORThree or more persons (health-care workers and/or patients and/or visitors) with clinical evidence of SARS with onset of illness in the same 10-day period and epidemiologically linked to a health-care facility.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly/monthly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.Place:Plot locations of case households and work sites using precise mapping.Person: Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. During the outbreak, count and report cases and deaths. Analyze age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors immediately.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)﷐Diagnostic test﷐Confirmed positive PCR for SARS virus: (Note: Testing meets the requirements for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS and almost always involves two or more different tests or the same assay on two or more occasions during the course of the illness or from different clinical sites)At least 2 different clinical specimens (eg nasopharyngeal and stool) ORThe same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more days during the course of the illness (e.g. 2 or more nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR2 different assays or repeat PCR using the original clinical sample on each occasion of testingSeroconversion by ELISA or IFA:Negative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on convalescent serum ORFour-fold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent phase sera tested in parallel.Virus isolation:Isolation in cell culture of SARS-Cov from any specimen; plus PCR confirmation using a validated method﷐Specimen﷐Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate specimen of choice for respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs or oropharyngeal swabs Stool Serum﷐When to collect﷐The respiratory tract specimen can be collected at any time, but are best taken during the acute phase of illness.The time collection of paired blood samples is very important:Collect an acute illness sample at first contact withthe patient at days 7, 14, 28 and 90 after onset where possible.Collect blood on discharge if collection of a convalescent sample is unlikely.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐SARS specimens should be handled according to appropriate biosafety practices in order to avoid laboratory-related infections and spread of disease to close contacts.Clinical samples from patients should be collected by trained personnel.Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate: have the patient sit with the head titled slightly backward. Instil 1.5 ml non-bacteriostatic sterile saline (Ph 7.0) into one nostril. Flush a plastic catheter or tubing (e.g. mucus trap tubing) with 2-3 ml of saline. Insert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate. Aspirate nasopharyngeal secretions. Repeat for the other nostril. Collect aspirates in sterile vial or mucus trap. Remove tubings and discard in plastic bag.Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs: use only sterile Dacron or rayon swab with plastic shafts. Place each swab immediately in a tube containing Virus Transport Media (VTM).Serum collection: Collect 5-10 ml of whole blood in a serum separator tube. Allow blood to clotRespiratory / stool / blood/serum specimens: Refrigerate immediately (4°C). If transport/ shipping will be international or will occur > 5 days after collection of last specimen, freeze the specimens at – 20 °C (serum), -20/-70 °C (respiratory specimens) for planned shipping with dry ice if available.Fixed tissues (formalin fixed) from all major organs. Store and ship fixed tissue at room temperature.﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for SARS are not routinely available. Advance arrangements are usually required for SARS diagnostic services.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 269, Content: Background﷐Severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc.An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics.To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with:history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°;and cough;with onset within the last 10 days;and requires hospitalization.﷐Respond to an alert threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Describe possible exposures.Person: For individual SARI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data, and for tracking patient if necessary), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of hospitalization (SARI patients only), Patient outcome (death, survival), Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on SARI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting. Recommended major age groupings for analysing are: 0 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <15 years, 15 to <50 years, 50 to <65 years, ≥ 65 years.For the laboratory data, as a minimum, it is recommended that the following data should be collected:• The number of samples tested for influenza during the week.• The proportion of samples that were positive for influenza for SARI • Types and subtypes of viruses detected during the week.• Results from antiviral resistance testing (if applicable).At the end, the following indicators or aggregated data should be collected and reported from each sentinel site:The number of new SARI cases from whom specimens were collected during the week, grouped by standard age groups, and the proportion of each of these that were positive for influenza.The total number of new SARI cases reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups (this includes cases that were not tested and/or did not have detailed data collected).The number of total new hospital admissions reported during the week in the sentinel hospital where SARI surveillance is being conducted, ideally grouped by the recommended age groups.The number of SARI deaths occurring in the healthcare facility sentinel site reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups.The proportion of cases having each of the chronic pre-existing medical illnesses for influenza positive SARI cases, reported separately.Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/AFRGeneric protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance: https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance ﷐Laboratory testing: Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs)﷐ 1- For the influenza virus:Specimens can be positive seven days or more after the onset of illness but ability to detect virus drops off notably after five to seven days, depending on the test used.Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method for detecting influenza virus and is the recommended influenza surveillance assay for most laboratories.Virus culture is also needed on at least a subset of specimens in order to allow detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of the virus.Antiviral resistance testing should be considered for high-risk patients if capacity exists in the laboratory in addition to taking a sample from non-high-risk patientsFurther technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011. https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/manual_diagnosis_surveillance_influenza/en/2- For others virus, and pathogens,please consult pathogens specific WHO guidances﷐References﷐WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014.

Q308,"Why is it important to observe the appropriate authorizations, clearances, and permissions during an investigation?","Section 4.1.5 emphasizes observing appropriate authorizations, clearances, ethical norms, and permissions during an investigation to ensure legal and ethical compliance. This includes official authorizations and agreements with influential community members.",TG Booklet 3,259,"Authorizations, Clearances, Permissions, Investigation, Legal Compliance, Ethical Norms","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 119, Content: Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 767, Content: At each level where data is received (health facility, district or national), the IDSR focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority IDSR diseases/events from the register and enter correctly into aggregated IDSR reporting forms while listing data from all the reporting sites. Troubleshooting and cleaning data prior to analysis is an important data management practice. Disease trends and maps will not be accurate if information about number of cases, time of onset, or geographic location of cases are missing. Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues.

The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.

Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide).

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/"
Q53,What kind of analysis surveillance focal points do at the health facility or district during an outbreak?,"The surveillance focal point draws epidemic curves, checks case fatality rates, and identifies potential risk factors.",TG Booklet 2,558,"Surveillance Focal Points, Health Facility, District, Epidemic Curves, Case Fatality Rates, Risk Factors","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacities of or national/central surveillance focal points are constrained, WHO country office working in close collaboration with the health cluster should assign a partner or a focal point in each affected district to:
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 558, Content: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 107, Content: The district level is the hub and focus for integrating surveillance functions. The district is the first level in the local health system, which has dedicated staff in all aspects of public health such as planning as well as supporting implementation of Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), monitoring health events in the health facility, and in the community, mobilizing community action, asking for national assistance to protect the district’s health. Similar functions also occur at the various administrative levels."
Q33,What are Community Case Definitions?,Community Case Definitions are usually simplified versions and use signs and symptomps that help community members to recognise when they need to refer a person for treatment and notify the health facility.,TG Booklet 2,159,"Community Case Definitions, Simplified Versions, Signs, Symptoms, Treatment, Notification, Health Facility.","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 436, Content: CIBS relies on reporting a suspected case or the trend of a specific disease(s) using a community case definition. A community case definition is two or three easily identified symptoms associated with a specific disease. It is a more basic form of syndromic (symptom) reporting that is used by health professional in national/IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. Examples include- Influenza (flu) community case definition: “sudden illness, fever, cough and difficulty breathing or new, floppy paralysis for AFP.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 159, Content: Case definitions at the community level are usually simplified and are used to facilitate rapid detection of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Provide information to community health workers, traditional healers, birth attendants, community leaders, religious leaders and community volunteers on how to recognize and report priority diseases, conditions or events to the health facility staff. The case definitions for community level should be simpler than those used in health facilities. A list of example of case definitions for use at the community level is in Annex 1B of this section."
Q1117,Why is tailoring IDSR to emergency contexts needed?,"Tailoring IDSR to emergency contexts is needed to improve early warning and response systems, thereby enhancing the capacity to rapidly identify and respond to health threats in emergency or fragile health system contexts.",TG Booklet 5,25,"IDSR Tailoring Necessity, Emergency Contexts, Early Warning, Response Systems, Health Threats Identification And Response","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies."
Q303,Why is it advisable to record and manage outbreak alerts electronically?,"Section 4.1.1 recommends recording and managing outbreak alerts electronically to improve efficiency and accuracy. Electronic event management systems are suggested as a feasible option for tracking and managing suspected outbreaks, enhancing the outbreak investigation and response process.",TG Booklet 3,"216, 249","Electronic Recording, Management, Outbreak Alerts, Efficiency, Accuracy, Electronic Event Management","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 218, Content: The existing electronic platforms offer the advantage of producing automated disease surveillance and epidemic bulletins or situation reports to inform disease surveillance and outbreak response decisions at all levels. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 214, Content: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 210, Content: The existing electronic platforms offer the advantage of automated analyses for both routine and case based outbreak data thus saving time and ensuring analysed data is available in real-time to inform disease surveillance and outbreak response decisions at all levels. "
Q430,Can you provide an example of parallel reporting during an outbreak?,"An example of parallel reporting might be different entities using separate reporting systems to convey information about the outbreak, leading to confusion and inefficiency in the response.",TG Booklet 3,378,"Parallel Reporting Example, Separate Reporting Systems, Outbreak Information, Confusion, Inefficiency","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 390, Content: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 371, Content: Recommendations: For controlling the situation further investigation/studies may be recommended. The district rapid response team should then immediately prepare an outbreak investigation report. This detailed report of the outbreak investigation should be prepared and disseminated immediately to the health facility where the outbreak occurred, district, national and also WHO. 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 232, Content: Respond to action threshold: Monkeypox﷐If a single case is confirmed:Maintain strict infection control measures practices throughout the duration of the outbreak.Mobilize the community for early detection and care.Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to implement infection control in the home care setting and during funerals.Conduct active searches for additional cases.Request additional help from national and international levels.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly/monthly.

Assess risk factors (contact with wild animals or another active confirmed case) immediately."
Q116,How is patient confidentiality and privacy maintained during public health reporting?,"Patient confidentiality and privacy are maintained by using unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names during reporting. Identifiable data should be maintained at the health facility level, and districts need guidelines on privacy and security of health data, guided by national-level guidelines.",TG Booklet 2,655-657,"Patient Confidentiality, Privacy, Reporting, Unique Identifiers, Health Data, Guidelines","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 657, Content: To ensure protection of patient confidentiality and privacy, when reporting, use unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names and this will prevent identities from being inadvertently disclosed. The identifiable data should be however maintained where public health surveillance interventions occur and it is usually at the health facility level. Districts need to have guidelines on privacy and security of health data, which should be guided by the National level guidelines.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 656, Content: The public health community recognizes that there might be risks to both individuals and communities, if one uses name-based reporting of private health-related information. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 767, Content: At each level where data is received (health facility, district or national), the IDSR focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority IDSR diseases/events from the register and enter correctly into aggregated IDSR reporting forms while listing data from all the reporting sites. Troubleshooting and cleaning data prior to analysis is an important data management practice. Disease trends and maps will not be accurate if information about number of cases, time of onset, or geographic location of cases are missing. Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues."

Q388,Compare the roles of case fatality rates and attack rates in outbreak investigations.,"Case fatality rates assess the severity of the outbreak by focusing on the proportion of cases resulting in death, while attack rates provide information about the overall impact of the outbreak by assessing the proportion of the population affected.",TG Booklet 3,"327, 328","Case Fatality Rates Vs. Attack Rates Roles, Severity Vs. Impact, Outbreak Investigations","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 328, Content: In outbreak situation, apart from Case fatality rates, you may also wish to calculate attack rates. See section 3, on how to calculate the Attack rate.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 859, Content: The attack rate is the measure of frequency of morbidity, or speed of spread, in an at risk population. An attack rate describes the risk of getting the disease during a specified period, such as the duration of an outbreak. Attack rate is defined as the frequency with which an event (such as a new case of illness) occurs in a population at risk over a specified period, and is usually calculated in an outbreak scenario. It is expressed per population at risk; for example: 4.5/100 000 population. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 873, Content: Public health programs can impact the case fatality rate by ensuring that cases are promptly detected and good quality case management takes place. Some disease control recommendations for specific diseases include reducing the case fatality rate as a target for measuring whether the outbreak response has been effective."
Q142,What are the purposes of analyzing surveillance data as mentioned in the guidelines?,"The purposes of analyzing surveillance data, as mentioned in the guidelines, include observing trends over time, alerting health staff and stakeholders about emergent events or unusual patterns, identifying geographic areas at higher risk, characterizing personal variables such as age, gender, or occupation that place a person at higher risk, and monitoring and evaluating public health interventions.",TG Booklet 2,732,"Analyzing Data, Surveillance Data, Purposes, Trends, Geographic Areas, Personal Variables, Monitoring, Evaluating Interventions","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 732, Content: It is not enough to only collect, record and report numerical information about illness, death and disability from the catchment area; the data must also be analysed at each level where it is collected.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation:Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb].Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case;Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other settingProbable case:  A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human.Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed casec Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.   d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9. Link of the WHO H5N1 case definitions: http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/case_definition2006_08_29/en/Link of the WHO H7N9 case definitions: https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/3-IHR case definition for human influenza caused by a new subtypeAn influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and if the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population. An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtypeRespond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:  Triggers for investigation  Examples of triggers include: respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals;clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks;SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases;SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections;SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens;number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected;laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen;abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; andunusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtypePrepare for the investigation- Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team- Inform relevant authorities- Gather information and suppliesInvestigate initial cases reportedProtect the investigatorsDevelop case definitionsFind additional cases- Identify and monitor contacts of cases- Active case findingEnhance surveillanceCollect specimensUndertake animal health and environmental investigationsManage and analyse the data (time, place, person)Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implementedImplement response and control measures- Manage the sick- Prevent further transmission- Infection prevention and control- Communicate the risk- Monitor the event and the responseReport and notify- Report results of the investigation- Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities.﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed:Manage the sick Prevent further transmissionInfection prevention and controlCommunicate the risk Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease  Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute        respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 269, Content: Background﷐Severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc.An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics.To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with:history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°;and cough;with onset within the last 10 days;and requires hospitalization.﷐Respond to an alert threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Describe possible exposures.Person: For individual SARI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data, and for tracking patient if necessary), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of hospitalization (SARI patients only), Patient outcome (death, survival), Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on SARI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting. Recommended major age groupings for analysing are: 0 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <15 years, 15 to <50 years, 50 to <65 years, ≥ 65 years.For the laboratory data, as a minimum, it is recommended that the following data should be collected:• The number of samples tested for influenza during the week.• The proportion of samples that were positive for influenza for SARI • Types and subtypes of viruses detected during the week.• Results from antiviral resistance testing (if applicable).At the end, the following indicators or aggregated data should be collected and reported from each sentinel site:The number of new SARI cases from whom specimens were collected during the week, grouped by standard age groups, and the proportion of each of these that were positive for influenza.The total number of new SARI cases reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups (this includes cases that were not tested and/or did not have detailed data collected).The number of total new hospital admissions reported during the week in the sentinel hospital where SARI surveillance is being conducted, ideally grouped by the recommended age groups.The number of SARI deaths occurring in the healthcare facility sentinel site reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups.The proportion of cases having each of the chronic pre-existing medical illnesses for influenza positive SARI cases, reported separately.Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/AFRGeneric protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance: https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance ﷐Laboratory testing: Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs)﷐ 1- For the influenza virus:Specimens can be positive seven days or more after the onset of illness but ability to detect virus drops off notably after five to seven days, depending on the test used.Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method for detecting influenza virus and is the recommended influenza surveillance assay for most laboratories.Virus culture is also needed on at least a subset of specimens in order to allow detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of the virus.Antiviral resistance testing should be considered for high-risk patients if capacity exists in the laboratory in addition to taking a sample from non-high-risk patientsFurther technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011. https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/manual_diagnosis_surveillance_influenza/en/2- For others virus, and pathogens,please consult pathogens specific WHO guidances﷐References﷐WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014.

Q279,How should the reported information be verified in an outbreak investigation?,"In an outbreak investigation, the reported information should be promptly verified for accuracy and conditions suggesting a true outbreak. Factors to consider during verification include the source of information, severity of reported illness, number of cases and deaths, demographics, mode of transmission, political or geographic considerations, partner and community relations, available resources, and the national or international concern.",TG Booklet 3,201-210,"Outbreak Investigation, Verification, Accuracy, Conditions, Factors, Source, Severity, Demographics, Transmission, Political, Geographic, Partner, Community, Resources, Concern","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 201, Content: Investigating outbreaks requires human, logistic and financial resources. When a suspected outbreak or event is reported, promptly verify that the information is accurate and reflects conditions suggesting a true outbreak or event. This will help to ensure that resources are used effectively. To verify the information, consider the following factors:
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 559, Content: At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 390, Content: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak"
Q205,"How are thresholds utilized in public health, as mentioned in the provided paragraphs?","Thresholds serve as markers indicating unusual situations that trigger specific actions in public health. They assist surveillance and program managers in determining when to take action and defining the necessary steps. The use of thresholds is outlined in Section 4.1 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. These thresholds are established based on information from two key sources. First, they may stem from a pre-existing situation analysis that identifies risks for the occurrence of a particular disease, specifying actions to be taken in response to identified risks. Second, international recommendations from technical and disease control program experts contribute to the formulation of thresholds.",TG Booklet 2,880-883,"Thresholds, Public Health, Actions, Surveillance, Program Managers, Section 4.1, 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, Situation Analysis, International Recommendations","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 890, Content: In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system.

Anthrax,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes

A sample case-based surveillance reporting form for recording case-based information is in Annex 2F at the end of this section. If a computer or other electronic device is available for surveillance or case management, complete and submit the form electronically to the next level. On electronic platforms, ensure you protect the patient privacy by encrypting patient ID data so only few health staff can access the detailed information, or you can also set up appropriate user rights such as creating a password for your use when using a common office computer. In the context of Malawi, this means the reporting can and shall be done electronically using either OHSP or EMRS."

Q392,How can a transmission tree assist in understanding the spread of a disease during an outbreak investigation?,"A transmission tree, starting with the index case, helps document routes of transmission in a given geographical area. It assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings, regulating infection transmission, and guiding control measures. It is updated frequently and aids in planning interventions (373).",TG Booklet 3,373,"Transmission Tree, Understanding Spread, Disease, Routes, Geographic Area, Planning Interventions","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 373, Content: To understand the spread of the disease you should draw a transmission tree starting with the index case. Moreover, the transmission tree assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings to the spread of the disease in the given geographical area and hence regulates the infection transmission and the control measures. Reconstruction of a transmission chain or tree can be done provided the information is obtained from line list, and also a review of the timeline of dates of illness or contact with other cases, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment. The transmission tree is important as it assists in documenting the routes of transmission in a given geographical area and hence enables planned interventions. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. "

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 573, Content: Each month, the health facility should calculate the total number of cases (Suspected and Laboratory Confirmed) and deaths due to priority diseases, conditions and events seen in the health facility. Separate totals are calculated for outpatient cases and inpatient cases. The summary totals are recorded on the Weekly and Monthly IDSR report form (please see Annex 2H) and sent to the district level. The district aggregates the totals from all the health facilities that reported and submit district summary totals to the central level. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 569, Content: Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken."

Q766,Why is early detection of Chikungunya cases important?,"Early detection of Chikungunya cases is crucial to implement timely interventions, prevent further transmission, and improve patient outcomes.",TG Booklet 6,155,Chikungunya: Importance Of Early Detection,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths. Report summary totals monthly.  During outbreak, count cases and deaths weekly. Analyse by age. Assess risk factors to improve     prevention of outbreaks.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Chikungunya﷐Diagnostic test﷐Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus; the virus may be isolated from the blood of acutely ill patients in newborn mice, mosquitoes or cell culture or detected using IFA or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case (s). Suspected CHIK cases occur in clusters.Collect representative specimens from suspected cases. If outbreak is confirmed, collect more specimens from cases and also mosquitoes from the affected homes for testing.Type of Specimen:-Acute-phase blood (0-10 days after onset)-Convalescent-phase blood (7 - 21 days after onset)Time of collection:When patient presents; collect second sample during convalescence. Between days 7 and 21 after onset.﷐How to prepare,store, and transport the specimen﷐Transport of specimens should comply with the WHO guidelines for the safe transport of infectious substances and diagnostic specimens (WHO, 1997).For ELISA:Refrigerate at 2º to 8º C serum or clot for testing within 24 hour. If kept for longer store at -80ºC.For virus isolation and RT_PCRStore frozen at -20ºC for short-term storage or at -70ºC or transport in fully charged dry shipper.Mosquitoes for testing should be transported in fully charged dry shipper. Focus onAedes species﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for Chikungunya are not routinely available. Contact the appropriate National authority or WHO. Ministry of Health, Disease Outbreak Management Unit should send samples to WHO reference labs e.g. KEMRIPreliminary results are ready within 24 hours after samples arrive in the laboratory.Confirmatory results are ready within a week from sample reception.

Q1069,Why is sentinel surveillance essential in estimating trends in larger populations?,"Sentinel surveillance is crucial for estimating trends in larger populations as it monitors the rate of occurrence of priority events in specific cohorts, such as geographical areas or population subgroups.",TG Booklet 1,82,"Sentinel Surveillance, Estimating Trends, Larger Populations, Priority Events, Specific Cohorts","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 82, Content: Sentinel surveillance: This type of surveillance is done for specific conditions in a specific cohort such as in a geographical area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. A given number of health facilities or reporting sites are usually designated as sentinel sites for monitoring rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance and they act as early warning and reporting sites. Sentinel sites are usually designated because they are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. Examples of sentinel surveillance include: sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 84, Content: Laboratory-based surveillance: This consists of surveillance conducted at laboratories for detecting events or trends that may not be seen as a problem at other locations or that originates from laboratory testing mainly done routinely or used when conducting sentinel surveillance. Laboratories can be the source of an initial alert for a specific outbreak or public health event that necessitates further epidemiological investigations. For example, the laboratory may be the first to detect the emergence of resistant strains in the community such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Other examples of laboratory-based surveillance include virological surveillance as influenza and bacteriological surveillance such as Antimicrobial resistance surveillance system. Recently, WHO has established a Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), which is a surveillance system for clinical specimens and is focusing initially on priority human bacterial infections namely E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp and N. gonorrheae. This type of laboratory surveillance provides information about antimicrobial resistance incidence, prevalence, and trends. Malawi is part of GLASS and is currently monitoring the priority bacterial infections listed above in 9 sites across the country.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 72, Content: Public Health Surveillance is the ongoing systematic identification, collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action. It includes the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those who need to know for effective and appropriate action. Surveillance is also essential for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health practice. Malawi has decided to achieve its public health surveillance objectives through the implementation of the IDSR strategy."
Q387,"Where in the outbreak investigation process is the analysis of data about the outbreak repeated many times, and why is this repetition necessary?","The analysis of data about the outbreak is repeated multiple times during the course of an outbreak (322). This repetition is necessary to summarize the outbreak, identify clues, understand its spread, determine the source, and assess persons at risk (322).",TG Booklet 3,322,"Data Analysis Repetition, Outbreak Course, Summarize, Identify Clues, Understand Spread, Determine Source, Assess Risk","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 322, Content: The methods for analysing outbreak data are similar to how the analysis of summary data is described in Section 3. Data about the outbreak is analysed and re-analysed many times during the course of an outbreak.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected. "

Computing completeness of reporting sites for each of the surveillance reports can: 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 234, Content: Completeness of case reporting refers to the match between the number of cases reported and the actual number of cases. This can be obtained by comparing the number of the reportable conditions reported to the next higher level over a period with the number of cases recorded in the patient register over the same period. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 212, Content: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. "

In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

Q1090,When was the IDSR strategy adopted by WHO AFRO member states?,The IDSR strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998.,TG Booklet 1,102,"IDSR, Adopted, September 1998","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 102, Content: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998 as the approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national level. IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 55, Content: In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.

This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes."
Q1227,What tools or methods are recommended for monitoring the timeliness of reporting in the context of IDSR?,"Recommended tools or methods include using a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to measure submission of reports by reporting units, identify which units have reported, and measure how many reports were timely, thereby ensuring effective monitoring.",TG Booklet 4,222-226,"Tools, Methods, Timeliness Monitoring, Reporting, IDSR, Monitoring Tool, Annex 8F, Reporting Units, Effective Monitoring","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 113, Content: To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012)
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 520, Content: The use of paper-based tools for implementation of IDSR has been an instrumental strategy for strengthening public health surveillance in the African region since IDSR was adopted in 1998. With the adoption of the International Health Regulations IHR (2005), which requires countries to strengthen capacity for disease surveillance and response, application of electronic tools to enhance real-time surveillance can improve timeliness of outbreak detection. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 390, Content: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak"

Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation:Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb].Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case;Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other settingProbable case:  A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human.Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed casec Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.   d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9. Link of the WHO H5N1 case definitions: http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/case_definition2006_08_29/en/Link of the WHO H7N9 case definitions: https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/3-IHR case definition for human influenza caused by a new subtypeAn influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and if the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population. An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtypeRespond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:  Triggers for investigation  Examples of triggers include: respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals;clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks;SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases;SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections;SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens;number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected;laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen;abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; andunusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtypePrepare for the investigation- Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team- Inform relevant authorities- Gather information and suppliesInvestigate initial cases reportedProtect the investigatorsDevelop case definitionsFind additional cases- Identify and monitor contacts of cases- Active case findingEnhance surveillanceCollect specimensUndertake animal health and environmental investigationsManage and analyse the data (time, place, person)Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implementedImplement response and control measures- Manage the sick- Prevent further transmission- Infection prevention and control- Communicate the risk- Monitor the event and the responseReport and notify- Report results of the investigation- Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities.﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed:Manage the sick Prevent further transmissionInfection prevention and controlCommunicate the risk Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease  Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute        respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/"

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 188, Content: Background﷐Hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP) is a chronic condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys.Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease related deaths are increasing in the African Region, and in 2000 accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the African Region. Prevalence ranges from 25% to 35% in adults aged 25 to 64 years.Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion worldwide and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the African Region are affected.Major risk factors for hypertension are ageing, lack of physical activity, obesity, and a diet high in salt and fat. Other risk factors include; tobacco and alcohol use.Lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP include; weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, increased physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Prevention of secondary illness by early detection and standardized treatmentEstimation of disease burden and reduction of identified risk factorsMonitor control and prevention activities﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected new case at first visit:Any individual presenting with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.Confirmed case:Any individual presenting on at least two occasions with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.* Report only the first diagnosis of the case in the health centre﷐Recommended public health action: Hypertension﷐Health promotion for non-communicable diseases focusing on HBP should be established, including community-based education on behaviour change and adoption of healthy lifestylesPromote secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Graph cases quarterly to analyse trends.Place: Compare district trends with national and regional trends.Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.   *Data for non-communicable diseases is often analysed for long term trends﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Diagnostic is clinical.﷐Reference﷐WHO, Atlas of heart disease and stroke, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004.Non communicable Diseases: A strategy for the African Region, AFR/RC50/10Cardiovascular Diseases in the African Region: Current situation and perspectives, AFR/RC55/12http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/http://www.afro.who.int/dnc/databases/afro infobase/index.htmlWHO CVD-risk management package for low-and medium resource settings.The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure U.S. Department of health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH Publication No. 03-5233, December 2003Handbook of Hypertension, Vol 20.

Q215,What triggers a response in surveillance for bacterial meningitis in the meningitis belt?,"In the meningitis belt, a response is triggered when the number of suspected cases reaches the epidemic threshold, which is 10 cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week or 5 suspected cases in one week for populations under 30,000, or a doubling of cases in a three-week period (with a minimum of 2 cases in one week).",TG Booklet 2,888,"Bacterial Meningitis, Meningitis Belt, Response, Epidemic Threshold, Suspected Cases, Inhabitants, Doubling Of Cases","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 706, Content: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component.

The district is the first level in the local health system, which has dedicated staff in all aspects of public health such as planning as well as supporting implementation of Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), monitoring health events in the health facility, and in the community, mobilizing community action, asking for national assistance to protect the district’s health. Similar functions also occur at the various administrative levels.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 80, Content: Facility-based surveillance: All reporting units (e.g., health facilities) are required to report on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis to the next level based on the categories of the diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, they are also required to report immediately, any epidemic prone disease to the next level."
Q355,Contrast immediate isolation with standard precaution in managing cases during an infectious disease outbreak.,"Immediate isolation may be required for suspected diseases to protect staff, patients, and the community, ensuring cases have access to facilities. Standard precaution involves applying precautions uniformly to all patients in the health facility and community, especially during an infectious disease outbreak.",TG Booklet 3,"299, 300","Immediate Isolation, Standard Precaution, Managing Cases, Infectious Disease Outbreak, Staff Protection, Uniform Precautions","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 299, Content: Use the case definition to isolate cases. Isolation is a critical step in limiting spread of disease and keeping healthcare facilities open and healthcare workers available. Depending on the suspected disease, immediate isolation may be required to protect staff, patients, and community members. Ensure the cases in isolation units have access to facilities like water and sanitary facilities. The health facility should be provided with advice, support and supplies. Use standard case management and infection prevention and control guidelines to manage cases.

Q823,"What is the estimated global prevalence of diabetes in 2030, and why is it important to implement evidence-based guidelines in clinical preventive measures?",The estimated global prevalence of diabetes in 2030 is projected at 4.8%. Implementing evidence-based guidelines in clinical preventive measures is crucial for effective management and reduction of diabetes cases.,TG Booklet 6,165,Diabetes Global Prevalence In 2030,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths

Q271,What led to the development of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy?,"The development of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was prompted by a strategy adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) in 1998. Initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS), it was later renamed IDSR to emphasize the connection between surveillance and response. Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005.",TG Booklet 3,145,"Integrated Disease Surveillance And Response, IDSR, WHO, AFRO, 1998, Adoption, Guidelines","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 102, Content: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998 as the approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national level. IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 50, Content: In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.

Q780,"When is antibiotic prophylaxis not recommended during Bacterial Meningitis epidemics, and why?",Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended during Bacterial Meningitis epidemics in the meningitis belt. The text does not provide a specific reason for this recommendation.,TG Booklet 6,142,Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues."

Q1008,What are the main causes of neonatal deaths globally?,"The three main causes of neonatal deaths globally are birth asphyxia, prematurity, and neonatal infections, accounting for about 80% of the deaths.",TG Booklet 6,245,"Neonatal Deaths, Causes, Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity, Infections","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 424, Content: Food and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing approximately 1.8 million people annually, most of whom are children. The identification of the source of an outbreak and its containment are critical to the IHR."
Q742,Compare the primary causative agents of bacterial meningitis in children.,"Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of bacterial meningitis cases in children.",TG Booklet 6,143,Bacterial Meningitis Primary Agents: Children Causative Pathogens,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread.Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year.Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens.The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly.

Q463,"How does conducting a register review contribute to outbreak investigation activities, and what steps are involved in the process?","Conducting a register review contributes to outbreak investigation by identifying suspected cases meeting standard case definitions. Steps involved include meeting with health facility staff, arranging the review, identifying information sources, checking registers for essential data, line-listing suspected cases, providing feedback to health facility staff, and reporting suspected cases to the next level. This process aids in understanding outbreak dynamics and strengthens case management and prevention efforts.",TG Booklet 3,"419, 425-444","Register Review Contribution, Outbreak Investigation, Identifying Suspected Cases, Case Definitions, Health Facility Staff, Record Review, Line-listing, Feedback, Reporting","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected.

Q394,Why is the reconstruction of a transmission tree important in outbreak investigations?,"Reconstruction of a transmission tree, using information from line lists, timeline of dates of illness or contact, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment, helps document routes of transmission in a geographical area. It enables understanding the spread of the disease and planning interventions (373).",TG Booklet 3,373,"Transmission Tree Reconstruction, Routes Of Transmission, Geographic Area, Understanding Spread, Planning Interventions","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 373, Content: To understand the spread of the disease you should draw a transmission tree starting with the index case. Moreover, the transmission tree assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings to the spread of the disease in the given geographical area and hence regulates the infection transmission and the control measures. Reconstruction of a transmission chain or tree can be done provided the information is obtained from line list, and also a review of the timeline of dates of illness or contact with other cases, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment. The transmission tree is important as it assists in documenting the routes of transmission in a given geographical area and hence enables planned interventions. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 374, Content: The tree needs to be updated frequently and if a new cluster of cases starts in any part of the district try to ask questions to establish an epidemiological link (See Annex 4J for an example of how to draw a transmission tree).
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. "
Q1045,How do the surveillance goals for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in the context of polio eradication differ from the surveillance goals for pneumonic plague?,"AFP surveillance targets 1 case per year per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years to provide certification of polio eradication. Pneumonic plague surveillance aims to detect all cases promptly to eliminate preventable deaths.",TG Booklet 6,"259, 260","Surveillance Goals, Acute Flaccid Paralysis, Pneumonic Plague","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Background﷐Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are transmitted from person-to-person via faecal-oral spread.Incubation period is 7 to 14 days for paralytic cases and the range is approximately 3 to 35 days. The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons.Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg.Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong.Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals.The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine. Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission.Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Obtain two or more stool specimens within 14 days of the onset of paralysis for viral isolation.Surveillance for AFP is used to capture all true cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Target for surveillance performance to provide certification of polio eradications is 1 case of AFP per year per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years.The ultimate objective of AFP surveillance is the eradication of the poliovirus.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any child under 15 years of age with acute flaccid paralysis or any person with paralytic illness at any age in whom the clinician suspects poliomyelitis.Confirmed case: A suspected case with virus isolation in stool.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 106, Content: Several activities are combined into one integrated activity, and take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target populations. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) often address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) or any unusual events. Thus, health workers who routinely visit health facilities to search for AFP cases also review district and health facility records for information about other priority diseases in the area. HSAs interact with their community members on a regular basis and ask about a range of diseases, conditions and events; communities know they can bring anything unusual to the attention of their focal persons, or through their VHCs.

Focus supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage during EPI.  ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases, or by date of onset. Evaluate the percent of suspected cases reported within 48 hours and the percentage with adequate laboratory specimen collection.Place:Plot location of case households. Investigate the circumstances of poliovirus transmission in each  case thoroughly. Examine the possibility of other potential areas of transmission.Person:Count cases. Analyse age distribution and number of polio vaccine doses received. Assess risk factors for low vaccine coverage."
Q421,"What is the role of the ministry responsible for security in enforcing control measures by law during an outbreak, and why is their involvement necessary?",The ministry responsible for security can assist in enforcing control measures by law.

Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 227, Content: Outbreak preparedness is paramount given the heightened risk of disease outbreaks in crisis affected populations. Preparedness efforts should as much as possible be integrated in the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the Ministry of Health leading the efforts and supported by WHO and partners. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead to enhance outbreak preparedness (WHO, 2012). The key preparedness efforts in crisis affected populations should entail the following: 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 376, Content: Once an outbreak is identified, control measures are important for interrupting disease transmission and or limiting exposure to the source of infection and preventing occurrence of future outbreaks. If a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified, control measures should target specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines gives a description of some of the control measures for each priority diseases and references for further reading."

IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1578, Content: IDSR strategy is an approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national levels. Since IDSR is a system with the potential to ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements, risk communication should be integrated in all the IDSR core functions and activities particularly detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, response and preparedness. The IDSR core functions and activities for each level of the health system are well illustrated in the Introduction section of this guideline. Effective risk communication is therefore needed to achieve the objectives for IDSR 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs."

Q899,"How are results interpreted for lymphatic filariasis, and where can additional information be found?","Positive results indicate the presence of W. bancrofti microfilariae or filarial antigen. Additional information can be found in WHO references, including monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the elimination program.",TG Booklet 6,204,"Results Interpretation, Lymphatic Filariasis, Microfilariae, Filarial Antigen Presence, WHO References, Monitoring, Epidemiological Assessment","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 203, Content: Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occurTreatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timoriModes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.Clinical description:Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).Chronic complications include:Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbsDamage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central levelSentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded.Confirmed case:A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case managementHygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis:Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and waterRaising the affected limb at nightExercising to promote lymph flowKeeping nails short and cleanWearing comfortable footwearUsing antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics.For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed:In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose.In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision.The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 yearsAreas with no concurrent OnchocerciasisDiethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, orDiethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administrationAnalyse the drug coverage in implementation unitsAssess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smearFilarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths.

Late neonatal death is defined as any death of live newborn occurring days 8 through 28 after birth. ﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐After determining that a perinatal death has occurred, the initial notification should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility or the district perinatal death review committee is required to review the case within seven (7) days PDR should be anonymous. It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicableThe reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation ﷐Recommended public health action﷐In many low-income countries, it is not possible to review all perinatal deaths given the large numbers of deaths and the limited capacity in human resources and time. However, it is important to accurately capture and classify the causes of those deathsSelected perinatal death should be reviewed and investigated to ascertain the cause.Surveillance for perinatal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where they occur.Response to any perinatal death is based on recommendations from the perinatal death review.Findings from review of the selected perinatal death should lead to actions to prevent similar deaths by identifying gaps that should be addressed at policy level and in both health facilities and communities.Monthly, quarterly or semi-annual analysis of aggregated data at larger health facilities and at district level  can lead to a more comprehensive approach  to address a particular problem across multiple facilities or communities or a problem in particular geographical areas where  they are occurring in greater numbers.  These should be conducted alongside those for maternal deaths by the MPDSR committee.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Measures of magnitude Number of stillbirths (SBR)Number of early neonatal deaths (NMR)Causes of stillbirthsCauses of early neonatal deaths% of stillbirths and neonatal deaths due to avoidable factors Descriptive analysis by person, place and time:Gestational age at time of death,Socioeconomic status of family, educational levels of parents Time and date of death, weekday or weekend.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women"
Q929,What are the major causes of maternal deaths globally?,"Severe bleeding, infections, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia), and obstructed labor are the major causes of maternal deaths globally. Complications after unsafe abortion contribute to 13% of maternal deaths.",TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Death Causes, Severe Bleeding, Infections, Hypertensive Disorders, Eclampsia, Obstructed Labor, Unsafe Abortion Complications","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths "

In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition.

The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 99, Content: During emergencies, populations are more vulnerable to morbidity, mortality and disability resulting from endemic and epidemic prone diseases. Thus, IDSR should be enhanced within 3-10 days of grading the public health emergency to facilitate rapid detection and response to disease outbreaks and public health events (WHO, 2009). Ultimately, this will contribute to the overall goal of reducing avoidable mortality, morbidity, and disability during humanitarian crises (WHO, 2009b). 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Member States in the African Region have thus recommended that IHR (2005) should be implemented in the context of IDSR. IHR (2005) is therefore not a separate surveillance system but rather requires countries to put in place a “sensitive, reliable and flexible surveillance system that meets international standards”. IDSR is a system with that potential and it will ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements. The IHR (2005) provides an opportunity to address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including PHEIC. Moreover, IHR also provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen surveillance and response systems, and to act as a potent driver for IDSR implementation. "

The case fatality ratio of SARS is estimated to range from 0% to more than 50% depending on the age group affected and reporting centre, with a crude global CFR of approximately 9.6%.The mean incubation period is 5 days, with the range of 2-10 days. Patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms including fever, malaise, myalgia, headache and rigors. Cough (initially dry), dyspnoea and diarrhoea may be present in the first week but more commonly reported in the second week of illness. Severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress. Up to 70% of the patients develop diarrhoea.Disease transmission occurs mainly during the second week of illness.The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes SARS is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans recently.In the inter-epidemic period, all countries must remain vigilant for the recurrence of SARS and maintain their ability to detect and respond to the possible re-emergence of SARSImmediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR ( Annex 2, IHR ).﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection and investigation of individuals with clinically apparent SARS-CoV.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case of SARS is an individual with:A history of fever, or documented fever ≥ 38 °C ANDOne or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath) ANDRadiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or ARDS or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause ANDNo alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness.Confirmed case of SARS: An individual who tests positive for SARS-CoV infection by the WHO recommended testing procedures.﷐Respond to suspected case﷐Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.Practice infection control precautions for an acute respiratory disease with epidemic/pandemic potential immediately and enhance Standard Precautions throughout the health care setting.Treat and manage the patient according to national guidelines.Collect and transport laboratory specimens from case-patient and from symptomatic contacts and arrange for laboratory testing.Review clinical history and exposure history during 2-10 days before disease onset.Identify and follow-up close contacts of case-patient.Conduct active searches for additional cases.Expedite the diagnosis.(WHO will assist in the investigation of SARS alerts as appropriate, including facilitating access to laboratory services)﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Response to SARS alert is same as response to suspected case (see above). SARS ALERT:An individual with clinical evidence of SARS AND with an epidemiological risk factor for SARS-CoV infection in the 10 days before the onset of symptoms ORTwo or more health-care workers with clinical evidence of SARS in the same health-care unit and with onset of illness in the same 10-day period ORThree or more persons (health-care workers and/or patients and/or visitors) with clinical evidence of SARS with onset of illness in the same 10-day period and epidemiologically linked to a health-care facility.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly/monthly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.Place:Plot locations of case households and work sites using precise mapping.Person: Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. During the outbreak, count and report cases and deaths. Analyze age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors immediately.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)﷐Diagnostic test﷐Confirmed positive PCR for SARS virus: (Note: Testing meets the requirements for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS and almost always involves two or more different tests or the same assay on two or more occasions during the course of the illness or from different clinical sites)At least 2 different clinical specimens (eg nasopharyngeal and stool) ORThe same clinical specimen collected on 2 or more days during the course of the illness (e.g. 2 or more nasopharyngeal aspirates) OR2 different assays or repeat PCR using the original clinical sample on each occasion of testingSeroconversion by ELISA or IFA:Negative antibody test on acute serum followed by positive antibody test on convalescent serum ORFour-fold or greater rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent phase sera tested in parallel.Virus isolation:Isolation in cell culture of SARS-Cov from any specimen; plus PCR confirmation using a validated method﷐Specimen﷐Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate specimen of choice for respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs or oropharyngeal swabs Stool Serum﷐When to collect﷐The respiratory tract specimen can be collected at any time, but are best taken during the acute phase of illness.The time collection of paired blood samples is very important:Collect an acute illness sample at first contact withthe patient at days 7, 14, 28 and 90 after onset where possible.Collect blood on discharge if collection of a convalescent sample is unlikely.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐SARS specimens should be handled according to appropriate biosafety practices in order to avoid laboratory-related infections and spread of disease to close contacts.Clinical samples from patients should be collected by trained personnel.Nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate: have the patient sit with the head titled slightly backward. Instil 1.5 ml non-bacteriostatic sterile saline (Ph 7.0) into one nostril. Flush a plastic catheter or tubing (e.g. mucus trap tubing) with 2-3 ml of saline. Insert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate. Aspirate nasopharyngeal secretions. Repeat for the other nostril. Collect aspirates in sterile vial or mucus trap. Remove tubings and discard in plastic bag.Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs: use only sterile Dacron or rayon swab with plastic shafts. Place each swab immediately in a tube containing Virus Transport Media (VTM).Serum collection: Collect 5-10 ml of whole blood in a serum separator tube. Allow blood to clotRespiratory / stool / blood/serum specimens: Refrigerate immediately (4°C). If transport/ shipping will be international or will occur > 5 days after collection of last specimen, freeze the specimens at – 20 °C (serum), -20/-70 °C (respiratory specimens) for planned shipping with dry ice if available.Fixed tissues (formalin fixed) from all major organs. Store and ship fixed tissue at room temperature.﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for SARS are not routinely available. Advance arrangements are usually required for SARS diagnostic services.

If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary."
Q1005,When are HIV test results usually available?,"HIV testing is highly regulated, and results are usually available within one week from arrival in the laboratory.",TG Booklet 6,239,"HIV Test Results, Availability, Laboratory Regulation","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 129, Content: Laboratory Test for Chronic Viral Hepatitis﷐Chronic Viral Hepatitis B (HBV)Basic initial laboratory investigations:The following laboratory tests should be requested after thorough history and physical examination in HBsAg positive individuals;Establish chronicity: Persistence of HBsAg for over 6 months after acute infection or presence of chronic liver disease/tumour.Establish HBe antigen (Ag)/Antibody (Ab) status: HBe Ag and AbEstablish inflammatory activity: liver function testsDetermine the level of viraemia – viral load: HBV DNAScreen for the presence of chronic liver disease or other complications using clinical examination for stigmata of chronic liver disease, abdominal ultrasound, coagulation profile, full blood countScreen for other co-infections: HCV Ab, HIV, HDV (in endemic regions)  Supportive investigation: determine blood urea and creatinineConsider liver biopsy or fibro-scan if indicatedChronic Viral Hepatitis C (HCV)Initial Investigations for HCV Patients:The screening test for HCV is a HCV Ab test. Unlike HBV testing, a positive HCV screening test (anti-HCV Ab) does not equate to active infection.  Also, the HCV testing often provides several false positive results. The following steps are recommended to establish active infection;Confirm HCV Ab testing using ELISAConfirm active infection using RNA testing; detectable HCV RNA confirms active infection; if RNA is undetectable, no further testing is indicated. It indicates past infection or false-positive serological testFurther testing for RNA positive cases include liver function test (LFT), abdominal ultrasound, viral genotyping, full blood count (FBC), blood urea and electrolytes (BUE) and creatinine Screen for co-infections - HIV, HBVAssess degree of inflammation and fibrosis by conducting the following test:Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) scoreFibrosis-4 (FIB4) score (the score uses a combination of age, platelet count, AST, ALT tests to derive the score)FibroscanLiver biopsy is the gold standard.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 239, Content: BackgroundAIDS is an infection of human lymphocytes (types of white blood cells) and other organs. It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human.Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others.Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region.Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years.Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers.Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS).Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted.Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission.Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TBImprove percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.Improve HIV/AIDS screening.﷐Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions. A positive ELISA for confirming HIV and a rapid test for confirming the positive results are sufficient for an epidemiologic case definition for HIV infection.﷐Public health actions﷐Monitor local STI and opportunistic infections, including TB, as possible cofactor for HIV.Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.Monitor use of condoms by commercial sex workers.Provide voluntary counselling and testing services at district and sub-district levels.Treatment of individual cases with antiretroviral therapy is not yet widely available in most African countries. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection (OI) may prolong life expectancy but this has not been widely evaluated in developing countries.Promote condom use, especially among high-risk individuals.Treat STIs, especially syphilis, chancroid diseases, and other ulcerative processes.Mobilize non-paid blood donors and promote appropriate use of blood.Promote good infection control practices within health facilities in the district.Educate patients and their sexual partners to refrain from donating blood, tissues, semen or breast milk.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Count new HIV/AIDS cases and report monthly. Analyse by number of cases confirmed with serology. At the end of the year, calculate the total number of cases and include trends for HIV sero-surveillance, STI surveillance and results of any special studies (socio-behavioural studies, drug sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, and so on).﷐Laboratory confirmation: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐Diagnostic test﷐Adults and children 18 months or older:HIV infection is diagnosed based on:- Positive HIV antibody testing (rapid or laboratory- based enzyme immunoassay). This is confirmed by a second HIV antibody test (rapid or laboratory-based enzyme immunoassay) relying on different antigens or of different operating characteristics; AND/ OR- Positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen assay) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determinationChildren younger than 18 months:HIV infection is diagnosed based on positive virological test for HIV or its components (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV p24 antigen) confirmed by a second virological test obtained from a separate determination taken more than four weeks after birth.Positive HIV antibody testing is not recommended for definitive or confirmatory diagnosis of HIV infection in children until 18 months of age.﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Obtain specimens according to national HIV/AIDS program strategy for clinical or epidemiological sampling.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen﷐Use universal precautions to minimize exposure to sharps and any body fluid.

Q1113,When is IDSR tailored to emergency contexts?,"IDSR is tailored to emergency contexts during humanitarian crises to provide rapid assessment, gap analysis, prioritization, and development of a plan of action.",TG Booklet 5,28-32,"IDSR Tailoring, Emergency Contexts, Humanitarian Crises, Rapid Assessment, Gap Analysis, Prioritization, Plan Of Action","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). "
Q43,What registers are used in Malawi to record cases?,The registers used in Malawi are: the Out-Patient department (OPD) or In-Patient Department (IPD) registers.,TG Booklet 2,169,"Registers In Malawi, Out-patient Department (OPD) Registers, In-patient Department (IPD) Registers","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 169, Content: Ensure that health facility personnel know the process for recording and reporting including reporting sites. Also ensure the health facilities record rumours. The registers, which are normally used in Malawi, are the Out-Patient Department (OPD) or In-Patient Department (IPD) registers. IDSR Focal Person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority diseases, conditions or public health events of IDSR from the register.  
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 768, Content: Ensure that Assistant Statistician or IDSR focal person knows the algorithm for reporting including reporting levels. Ensure also, they are recording rumours in the rumours log books.  The registers which are normally used in Malawi are the OPD and IPD registers and the IDSR Focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority disease of IDSR from the registers.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 530, Content: Follow up the initial verbal report with a written report using a standardized case-based report form. A sample case-based surveillance reporting form for recording case-based information is in Annex 2F at the end of this section. If a computer or other electronic device is available for surveillance or case management, complete and submit the form electronically to the next level. On electronic platforms, ensure you protect the patient privacy by encrypting patient ID data so only few health staff can access the detailed information, or you can also set up appropriate user rights such as creating a password for your use when using a common office computer. In the context of Malawi, this means the reporting can and shall be done electronically using either OHSP or EMRS."
Q1012,What is the primary goal of perinatal deaths surveillance?,"The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by actively identifying and reporting cases at community and facility levels, assessing the magnitude, and identifying causes and contributing factors.",TG Booklet 6,246,"Perinatal Deaths Surveillance, Goal, Preventable Stillbirths, Neonatal Deaths, Identification, Reporting, Magnitude, Causes, Factors","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 246, Content: Standard case definitions: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Perinatal death includes the death of a baby of at least 28 weeks of gestation and/or 1,000 g in weight and early neonatal death (the first seven days after birth)A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 g birthweight and/or at least 28 weeks gestation and 35 cm long. Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life. Day 1 is clinically considered the first day of life.  Late neonatal death is defined as any death of live newborn occurring days 8 through 28 after birth. ﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐After determining that a perinatal death has occurred, the initial notification should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility or the district perinatal death review committee is required to review the case within seven (7) days PDR should be anonymous. It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicableThe reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation ﷐Recommended public health action﷐In many low-income countries, it is not possible to review all perinatal deaths given the large numbers of deaths and the limited capacity in human resources and time. However, it is important to accurately capture and classify the causes of those deathsSelected perinatal death should be reviewed and investigated to ascertain the cause.Surveillance for perinatal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where they occur.Response to any perinatal death is based on recommendations from the perinatal death review.Findings from review of the selected perinatal death should lead to actions to prevent similar deaths by identifying gaps that should be addressed at policy level and in both health facilities and communities.Monthly, quarterly or semi-annual analysis of aggregated data at larger health facilities and at district level  can lead to a more comprehensive approach  to address a particular problem across multiple facilities or communities or a problem in particular geographical areas where  they are occurring in greater numbers.

In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 75, Content: Active surveillance:  It involves an ongoing search for cases in the community or the health facilities. This may involve regular contacts with key reporting sources, such as telephone calls to health care workers at a facility or laboratory or physically moving to the source and records review of data. Examples include active search of cases of measles and polio, as well as during outbreaks where one must institute mechanisms for active finding of additional cases. "

For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website.

Construct an epidemic curve.Place:Map location of case households.Person:Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. During the outbreak, count and report cases (including suspected and confirmed) and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors (contact with wild animals or another active confirmed case) immediately."
Q1153,When is a coordinator recruited at the national level during humanitarian crises?,A coordinator is recruited during acute crises or complex emergencies when the capacity of the national surveillance coordination unit in the MoH is greatly constrained.,TG Booklet 5,128,"Coordinator Recruitment, National Level, Acute Crises, Complex Emergencies, Surveillance Coordination","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 128, Content: The overall coordination of data collection, entry, analysis and dissemination during humanitarian crises should be undertaken by the IDSR unit within the Ministry of Health (MoH) with support from WHO and partners, and fed as necessarily to the PHEOC if one already exists. If the PHEOC exists, the National Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) coordinated by the national PHEOC is activated to support the coordination and response activities in the affected regions and districts. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacity of the national surveillance coordination unit in the MoH is greatly constrained, a coordinator (typically an epidemiologist or public health expert with experience in disease surveillance and disease control in emergencies) can be recruited to support the Ministry of Health during the acute phase of the crisis (WHO, 2012). The functions of the coordinator will be guided by the initial rapid assessment and   should include but not be limited to:
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations.

Q86,What is the role of CBS focal persons in a community-based surveillance (CBS) system?,"CBS focal persons act as community informants who identify and report events with public health significance in the community. They report to the health facility or, in serious cases, directly to district authorities.",TG Booklet 2,615,"CBS Focal Persons, Community-based Surveillance, Community Informants, Reporting Events, Public Health Significance","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 834, Content: Community-Based Surveillance Focal Persons (See Definition in Introduction section) can be the first responders and take steps to make the situation as safe as possible for the community. Some of the actions include the following:
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 439, Content: A crucial step in establishing the Community Based Surveillance is to ensure there is a buy in of both the national and subnational level authorities. This will enable the CBS system to be recognized formally as part of the National Surveillance System and designated people will then be appointed. A designated health facility manager or surveillance officer responsible for coordinating CBS activities should therefore: 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 254, Content: Monitoring CBS system is equally important as monitoring health facility, districts and national level. Community health workers/community focal persons/volunteers involved in the system must understand the benefit of the system, and that their input is valued and can assist in improvement or adaptation of the system to work better for the community. "
Q1164,Where should new case visits be registered and counted during a humanitarian crisis?,"New case visits should be registered and counted in outpatient clinics, inpatient clinics, laboratories, mobile clinics, IDP/refugee camp clinics, and other sources of event-based information.",TG Booklet 5,158-164,"New Case Visits, Registration, Counting, Humanitarian Crisis, Clinics, Laboratories, Idp/refugee Camps","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 150, Content: During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 438, Content: Go to the selected wards as scheduled. During the visit, look in the health facility registers for cases and deaths that may be suspected cases of a priority disease. These should be cases or deaths that meet the standard case definition for suspected cases. Find out whether the suspected case was investigated and reported according to the national guidelines.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 191, Content: Humanitarian crises tend to disrupt existing national disease surveillance platforms for transmitting data. In the same way, crisis-affected populations may have additional public health needs beyond the ones established through the routine IDSR. Flexibility should be exercised to update the existing IDSR/HMIS reporting tools to capture diseases, conditions, and events unique to crisis affected populations. Consequently, the existing IDSR/HMIS paper-based tools and/or electronic reporting platforms should be updated to capture the additional diseases, condition, and public health events that are unique to crisis affected populations. "
Q198,How can a table be used for person analysis in disease surveillance?,"A table can be used to analyze characteristics of patients with a given disease, presenting data in a simple way for surveillance and monitoring.",TG Booklet 2,844,"Using A Table For Person Analysis, Characteristics Of Patients, Age Groups, Cases, Deaths","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 844, Content: For each priority disease or condition under surveillance, use a table to analyse characteristics of the patients who are becoming ill. A table is a set of data organized in columns and rows. The purpose of a table is to present the data in a simple way. For surveillance and monitoring, use a table to show the number of cases and deaths from a given disease that occurred in a given time.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 821, Content: Analysis by person describes the population with the condition as well as those at risk of contracting the condition or being exposed to factors associated with it. These factors may reveal important clues to understanding the disease, why it occurred and how to control it, thus preventing further spread. Make a distribution of the cases by each of the person variables in the reporting form. For example, compare the total number and proportion of suspected and confirmed cases by:
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 579, Content: Each week, month, or quarter, a records clerk or statistician or IDSR focal person calculates summaries for all the diseases and records them in a standard form. Events should be aggregated separately from diseases. In case the health facility is equipped with computers, individual patient records should be entered, from which the IDSR priority diseases or conditions subset will be extracted and analysed to get the required weekly, monthly or quarterly compilations."
Q28,Which stakeholders should be involved in IDSR planning?,"All stakeholders should be involved at the onset throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation phases. Stekeholders include traditional leaders, civil societies, faith based leaders, youth and women church organisations, NGOs, political leaders, vulnerable groups, etc, and teh community members themselves.",TG Booklet 3,1619,"IDSR Planning, Stakeholders, Involvement, Traditional Leaders, Civil Societies, Ngos, Community Members.","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 137, Content: The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacities of or national/central surveillance focal points are constrained, WHO country office working in close collaboration with the health cluster should assign a partner or a focal point in each affected district to:
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 495, Content: The targeted public health workforce for IDSR are primarily staff at all levels of the health system (both human, animal and environment), data management and digital health personnel who will oversee the Information Communication Technology (ICT) aspect of the system at all levels, supervisory and disease specific program personnel at all levels i.e. local, district and decision makers at national levels. Malawi will embrace an interoperable and “One Health” approach of strengthening eIDSR by creating systematic linkages and information sharing platforms. This will be done by formalizing agreements between Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Nature Resources. Internally, the eIDSR will include all relevant health programmes, departments, sections and units within the MoH, i.e. HMIS, IDSR, Maternal (MDSR), community health service section (iCHIS) and Newborn (PDSR), health services delivery information system (EMRS), national public health reference laboratories and laboratory networks (LIMS). The relevance stakeholders in the Ministry of Agriculture include animal health department, livestock / wildlife units with surveillance function, and veterinary facilities/institutions. Lastly the Ministry Nature Resources for the environment surveillance affairs (e.g. air, water, wastes, soil, etc.). 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 534, Content: Ensure that adequate information is available for events which are reported, as some events might have a link with the Agricultural or Livestock, Wildlife sector or Food or environment or other sectors including the community.  Such information sharing is crucial and should start at the community level, health facility and subsequently at the district. At the National level, the IDSR Focal Person/IHR National Focal Point (NFP) should notify WHO of an event that is a potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) using decision instrument in the IHR 2005 (Annex 2A)."
Q1244,How can the timeliness and completeness of reporting be improved at various levels?,"Timeliness and completeness of reporting can be improved by monitoring the dates on which reports are received, measuring submission of reports by reporting units, ensuring deadlines for each level, and providing feedback on the quality of data sent to higher levels.",TG Booklet 4,245-246,"Timeliness Improvement, Completeness Improvement, Reporting, Various Levels, Report Submission Monitoring, Reporting Units, Deadlines, Data Quality Feedback","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 428, Content: *The timeliness and completeness are expressed as percentages (%). When the surveillance system is good, the rates for timeliness and completeness should approach 100%. This table allows for monitoring the progress of these two indicators in the district so that action can be taken to improve timeliness for each health facility in the district.￼ 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 107, Content: ₋        Tracking progress of improvements in targeted indicators of the quality and attributes of the system, such as timeliness of reporting and completeness of reporting 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 212, Content: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. "
Q1071,"Who conducts syndromic surveillance, and what is its primary purpose?","Syndromic surveillance is conducted by health authorities and is an active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without laboratory diagnosis. Its primary purpose is to collect data on various conditions as alerts for specific diseases, although it requires more investigation due to its lack of specificity.",TG Booklet 1,83,"Syndromic Surveillance, Health Authorities, Standard Case Definitions, Clinical Features, Data Collection, Disease Alerts, Investigation","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Syndromic surveillance: An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or ""rash illness"" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 642, Content: Public health laboratory system complements the syndromic disease surveillance. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary."
Q213,How is detection of rare diseases done?,"Detection of rare diseases is often done by identifying individual cases since these diseases are infrequent and may not follow typical patterns. In the context of disease surveillance, the detection of a single case of a rare disease can be considered unusual and is treated as a serious event. Surveillance systems for rare diseases focus on identifying any occurrence, as even a single case may indicate the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.",TG Booklet 2,887,"Rare Diseases, Detection, Individual Cases, Infrequency, Surveillance Systems, Single Case, Rapid Transmission, Case Fatality Rates","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.

Q1122,Why is there a need to tailor IDSR to emergency contexts?,"There is a need to tailor IDSR to emergency contexts due to the major implications on population health and health services, including surveillance systems, resulting from conflicts and disasters disrupting the overall functionality of the health system.",TG Booklet 5,82-83,"Tailoring IDSR, Emergency Contexts, Population Health, Health Services, Surveillance Systems, Health System Disruption","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies."
Q655,What actions should be taken if a single case is confirmed?,"Maintain strict infection prevention and control practices, mobilize the community, establish an isolation ward, and conduct case-contact follow-up.",TG Booklet 6,122,"Maintain Strict Infection Prevention And Control Practices, Mobilize The Community, Establish An Isolation Ward, And Conduct Case-contact Follow-up.","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: Respond to alert threshold﷐ If a single case is suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients/people and strict infection prevention procedures should be implemented. Standard precautions should be enhanced throughout the health care setting and in communities.Treat and manage the patient with supportive care.Collect the appropriate specimen while observing strict infection prevention and control procedures to confirm the case.Complete a laboratory request form, use triple packaging of the specimens (see detailed SOP for triple packaging) and mark well the containers to warn of a potential laboratory biosafety riskConduct case-contact tracing and follow-up and active case search for additional cases (See detailed SOP for contact tracing and follow up).Begin or enhance death reporting and surveillance; as well as screening procedures for fever and VHD related symptoms
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 187, Content: Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication."

It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 278, Content: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women"

Q824,"Compare the risk factors for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and which type represents more than 85% of diabetes cases?","Risk factors for Type 1 include genetic predisposition, while Type 2 is associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Type 2 diabetes represents more than 85% of diabetes cases.",TG Booklet 6,165,Risk Factors For Type 1 Vs. Type 2 Diabetes,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 165, Content: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the diseaseMonitor trends and risk factorsIdentify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural)Monitor prevention and control program activities

Q540,Does the TG contain case definitions for Maternal Deaths?,"Yes, Page 108 of TG Booklet 6 Section 11",TG Booklet 6,43,"TG, Maternal Deaths, Case Definitions, Page 108, Booklet 6, Section 11","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Suspected: Isolate, Treat, And Trace Contacts.","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 117, Content: Background﷐In this sub-section, you will find general information about:The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information.Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on.Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 187, Content: Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated."
Q1062,"Why is the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy recommended for tuberculosis, and how successful has it been in controlling the disease?","The DOTS strategy is recommended to maximize compliance, treatment efficacy, and reduce drug-resistant strains. It has been implemented in at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region with varying degrees of success.",TG Booklet 6,286,"Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course Strategy, Tuberculosis Control, Implementation, Success","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 101, Content: The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1582, Content: When the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, direct interventions may take time to organize and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, often stands as the first and most important public health tool in managing a risk. Pro-active risk communication encourages the public and service providers to adopt protective behaviours when they are linked to functioning systems and services. It facilitates heightened disease surveillance, reduces confusion, and minimizes miscommunication and falsehoods (rumours) in relation to the cause, transmission of a disease and proven effective protective actions. It allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response (WHO, 2008)."
Q855,When should specimens be collected for laboratory confirmation of Ebola or Marburg?,"Specimens should be collected from the first suspected case, and if there are more than one suspected cases, specimens should be collected until specimens have been collected from 5 to 10 suspected cases.",TG Booklet 6,180,"Specimen Collection Timing, First Suspected Case, 5 To 10 Suspected Cases","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 180, Content: Background﷐The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses.Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo.More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007).These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented.Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved.Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures.Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days.Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses.High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%)There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes.Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used.Prevention efforts such as social distancing and vaccination should be supported. Monitoring case fatalities, assess spread of illness (chains of transmission), and death. Guide the support and care of survivors﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Routine Surveillance:Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.Community-based surveillance: Alert case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area; ORAt least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine; ORAny sudden death Actions to take: If an alert case (living or dead) is identified, report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre This definition of “alert cases” for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local eventIn outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions may guide appropriate detection of cases:Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal (for Ebola) - a mine (for Marburg) ORAny person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding;  OR Any sudden, inexplicable death; ORA person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal (for Ebola); a mine (for Marburg) ﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Note: During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms, therefore, the case definition for suspected or confirmed case does not include it. Probable case: Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician; OR Any deceased suspected case (where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation) having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case Note: if laboratory specimens are collected in due time during the illness, the preceding categories are reclassified as “laboratory confirmed” cases and “non-case”.Laboratory confirmed case: Any suspected or probably cases with a positive laboratory result for virus presence. Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Marburg or Ebola virus. Non-Case: Any suspected or probable case with negative laboratory results. “Non-case” showed no specific antibodies, RNA or specific detectable antigens﷐Respond to alert threshold: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐If a single case is suspected:If a single case is suspected: Report case-based information immediately (phone or text with information from generic case investigation form) to the appropriate authorities. Collect specimen to confirm the case(s). Carefully complete specimen request form and mark containers to warn laboratory of risk. Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier nursing techniques implemented. Eliminate body fluid exposure and wear VHF appropriate PPE.

Low risk contacts under daily follow-up should be encouraged to limit their movementsBegin surveillance and screening of dead bodies including: any individual aged 5 years or more, dying within 14 days of symptom onset from an indeterminate cause, OR still births.) Treat accompanying similar symptoms, in particular malaria, typhoid, fever, louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Implement IPC measures and avoid nosocomial transmission by strict implementation of barrier nursing. If barrier nursing material is not available, avoid any invasive procedure (e.g. blood sampling, injections, placement of infusion lines, or nasogastric tubes) and put on at least one layer of gloves for any direct contact with the patient; double gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that poses an increased risk for blood exposure. There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. For EVD, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaitedConfirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event.

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/"

Q117,Which circumstances might require the use of names during an outbreak of infectious diseases?,The use of names may be required during an outbreak of infectious diseases for the purpose of contact tracing. Refer to Section 4 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines for guidance on contact tracing and recording.,TG Booklet 2,658,"Outbreak, Infectious Diseases, Use Of Names, Contact Tracing, Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: Provide clear information to frontline staff about Why report unusual events? What events are reportable? How to report an unusual event? What happens after you report? Examples of event reporting:Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal. Detect cases. Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.

For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease.

Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 150, Content: During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:"
Q223,Why is it important to have suggested thresholds for specific diseases?,"Suggested thresholds provide guidance on when to take action in response to specific diseases or conditions, helping in the effective management of public health situations.",TG Booklet 2,891,"Suggested Thresholds, Specific Diseases, Guidance, Action, Public Health Management","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 301, Content: ·             Some data are analysed in the health facility to identify thresholds to take action both for routinely reported priority diseases (disease of public health importance) and case-based diseases (epidemic-prone diseases, and diseases targeted for eradication or elimination). 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 890, Content: In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system. This facilitates use of surveillance information for action at the level where it is collected. Periodically, surveillance thresholds are assessed and reset at national or international levels according to the observed trends of the diseases, events or conditions under surveillance.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates."

The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

Q789,How does the incubation period of Bacterial Meningitis compare to that of Chikungunya?,The text does not provide specific information on the incubation period of Bacterial Meningitis or how it compares to that of Chikungunya.,TG Booklet 6,142,Incubation Periods: Bacterial Meningitis Vs. Chikungunya,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility."
Q216,What is the alert threshold for bacterial meningitis in terms of suspected cases and population size?,"The alert threshold for bacterial meningitis in the meningitis belt is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week, or 2 suspected cases per week for populations under 30,000, or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years.",TG Booklet 2,888,"Alert Threshold, Bacterial Meningitis, Meningitis Belt, Suspected Cases, Population Size, Increased Incidence","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 888, Content: In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age. Please see Diarrhoea with dehydration summary guidelines.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea. To confirm an outbreak, collect and transport stool specimens transported in Cary-Blair medium.Do immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths when an outbreak is suspected.

Consider social distancing strategies.Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting.Request additional help from other levels as needed.Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings.Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases.Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff.Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements.There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers.Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes.A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

Q92,What is the role of the laboratory system in complementing syndromic disease surveillance?,The public health laboratory system complements syndromic disease surveillance.,TG Booklet 2,642,"Laboratory System, Complementing, Syndromic Disease Surveillance","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 642, Content: Public health laboratory system complements the syndromic disease surveillance. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Syndromic surveillance: An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or ""rash illness"" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary."

Refer newly identified cases to health facilities for treatment.",TG Booklet 3,"307, 308","Contact Persons Search, Community, Risk Areas, Informants, Illness Investigation, Information Collection, Outbreak Magnitude, Geographic Extent, Treatment Referral","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 308, Content: The areas for the search may be influenced by the disease, its mode of transmission, and factors of risk related to time, place and person. Visit those places and talk to people who had, or were likely to have had, contact with the patient. Ask if they or anyone they know has had an illness or condition like the one being investigated. Find out if anyone else in the area around the case has been ill with signs or symptoms that meet the case definition. Find out if there were any recent deaths. If they say yes, find out what were the signs and symptoms of the person(s) that died. Enquire about the people that took care of these people when they were sick and also the preparation of the dead before and during the burial ceremony. Collect information that will help to describe the magnitude and geographic extent of the outbreak.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 173, Content: At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 189, Content: Step 6 - Respond: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the problem, identify gaps and vulnerabilities, coordinate and mobilize resources and personnel to implement the appropriate public health response. The results of the investigation should guide the response. At National level, a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) should be activated under the leadership of a government official with decision-making authority and at the district level a similar coordination mechanism for response. Identify a spokesperson and ensure a risk communication plan is in place and put a coordination platform for all stakeholders who are involved in communication.

A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 197, Content: Identify all of the health facilities, Points of Entry, and any other location in the country including community focal points required to report surveillance data or events to the next level. Create relationships with private facilities and NGOs, including the faith-based sites in the country, and involve them in surveillance activities.  All private laboratory facilities should be reporting to the District Health Office. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 82, Content: Sentinel surveillance: This type of surveillance is done for specific conditions in a specific cohort such as in a geographical area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. A given number of health facilities or reporting sites are usually designated as sentinel sites for monitoring rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance and they act as early warning and reporting sites. Sentinel sites are usually designated because they are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. Examples of sentinel surveillance include: sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio."
Q759,"What actions are recommended in response to the alert threshold for BU, and why are these actions important?","Actions include reporting, specimen collection, wound dressing, and initiating antibiotic treatment. These actions are crucial for early case management, confirmation, and prevention of disabilities associated with BU.",TG Booklet 6,150,BU Alert Threshold Response: Recommended Actions,"Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 500, Content: In IDSR, there are two types of thresholds used to initiate response: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. These thresholds are normally expressed in terms of the number (or proportion) of cases of a disease and the critical point (threshold) beyond which action must be taken. Trained health care personnel should always determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Statistical tools and methods may be applied to determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Thresholds for alerts and epidemic for epidemic prone diseases, conditions or events are shown in Section 11 of these  3rd Edition of the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines.

Q1210,Which attributes define the quality of the surveillance system?,"Attributes defining the quality of the surveillance system include completeness, timeliness, usefulness, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and reliability.",TG Booklet 4,198-209,"Quality Attributes, Surveillance System, Completeness, Timeliness, Usefulness, Sensitivity, PPV, Specificity, Representativeness, Simplicity, Flexibility, Acceptability, Reliability","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 198, Content: The quality of the surveillance system is defined by attributes such as: 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 248, Content: Some other key important attributes are summarized in the table below and can be used to assess the quality of surveillance system. These attributes should be used to assess the quality of surveillance systems during periodic evaluation assessments (Table 8.2). Readers are referred to the updated framework for evaluating surveillance systems for a complete list of attributes. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 210, Content: Periodically the quality of the surveillance system should be assessed based on these attributes. Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. "
Q1110,Which types of community-based surveillance strategies can be used?,"Two strategies can be used: Community Event-Based Surveillance (CEBS) and Community-Indicator Based Surveillance (CIBS). CEBS relies on reporting of unusual events, while CIBS relies on reporting suspected cases based on community case definitions.",TG Booklet 1,432-436,"CEBS, CIBS, Unusual Events, Community Case Definitions","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 86, Content: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 431, Content: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event.

Q849,Why is laboratory confirmation of specific agents causing outbreaks not routinely recommended for surveillance purposes for diarrhoea with dehydration?,Laboratory confirmation of specific agents causing outbreaks is not routinely recommended for surveillance purposes for diarrhoea with dehydration to facilitate prompt response and management.,TG Booklet 6,172,Laboratory Confirmation For Diarrhoea With Dehydration,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread.Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year.Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens.The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly. Laboratory confirmation can confirm specific pathogenic agent outbreak, but laboratory confirmation is not necessary for routine surveillance of diarrhoea with dehydration.Monitor antimicrobial resistance during outbreaks of bacterial origin.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in the past 24 hours with or without dehydration and:Some dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: restlessness, irritability; sunken eyes; thirsty; skin pinch goes back slowly, orSevere dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: lethargy or unconsciousness; sunken eyes; not able to drink or drinking poorly; skin pinch goes back very slowly.Confirmed case:Suspected case confirmed with stool culture for a known enteric pathogen. Note: Laboratory confirmation of specific agent causing outbreak is not routinely recommended for surveillance purposes.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 206, Content: Laboratories should be used as early warning alerts to detect pathogens and other hazards that have potential to spread e.g. emergence of resistant strains in the hospital or the community (e.g. multi-drug resistant tuberculosis).

Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret.

Q922,What are the main causes of malnutrition according to the provided paragraphs?,"Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education, and repeated infections.",TG Booklet 6,220,"Malnutrition Causes, Socio-economic Conditions, Water Sanitation, Mothers’ Nutritional Education, Repeated Infections","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Q907,How does severe malnutrition contribute to child mortality?,It may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.,TG Booklet 6,220,"Severe Malnutrition, Child Mortality, Direct Cause Of Death, Indirect Cause, Childhood Illnesses, Diarrhoea, Pneumonia","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread.Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year.Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens.The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly. Laboratory confirmation can confirm specific pathogenic agent outbreak, but laboratory confirmation is not necessary for routine surveillance of diarrhoea with dehydration.Monitor antimicrobial resistance during outbreaks of bacterial origin.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in the past 24 hours with or without dehydration and:Some dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: restlessness, irritability; sunken eyes; thirsty; skin pinch goes back slowly, orSevere dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: lethargy or unconsciousness; sunken eyes; not able to drink or drinking poorly; skin pinch goes back very slowly.Confirmed case:Suspected case confirmed with stool culture for a known enteric pathogen.

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 297, Content: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time.

Refrigerate the capped syringe and send it to the laboratory as soon as possible.﷐Results﷐Isolation of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae b. Neisseria meningitidis is a fastidious organism, is expensive and difficult. It requires excellent techniques for specimen collection and handling and expensive media and antisera.Initial specimens in an outbreak or for singly occurring isolates of N. meningitis or Neisseria meningitidis should be serogrouped and an antibiogram performed to ensure appropriate treatment.Trans isolate medium (TI) is stable. If properly stored at temperature (4ºC) it can be kept for up to two years after preparation. In the refrigerator, the liquid phase turns gelatinous but reliquifies at room temperature. Unused TI bottles should be kept tightly sealed. If there is any colour change (yellowing or clouding of the liquid medium) or drying or shrinkage of the agar slant, the medium should not be used.﷐Reference: Bacterial Meningitis﷐Managing meningitis epidemics in Africa: A quick reference guide for health authorities and health-care workers Revised 2015, WHO/HSE/GAR/ERI/2010.4.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 289, Content: Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness.Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually. In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers.Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection.Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries.People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months.Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verificationIdentify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures﷐Standard case definitions﷐Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea.Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool.

Risk communication is real time two-way exchange of information, perceptions and advice among risk assessors, risk managers, and various groups of people in the society about the likelihood and consequences of harm from the event (WHO, 2005). Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Step 7 – Risk communication: Risk communication is an essential element for all surveillance systems, as well as for disaster and emergency preparedness and response.  It is the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts, community leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. Encourage future cooperation by communicating with all levels including communities that provided data, reported outbreaks, cases and events, about the investigation outcome and success of response efforts. Acknowledge the reporting by communities.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1728, Content: Understanding public perceptions, concerns, fears and expectations is as critical for risk communication as understanding the risky practices and behaviours that affect risk.  The understanding of communities must start before and during an emergency. There are many ways to better listen to community concerns and understand their contexts that influence if the advice for corrective or preventive practices given to them will actually be accepted and acted upon. These include Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) surveys or mini-surveys; community walk-throughs, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, getting feedback from stakeholders, social media and media monitoring, etc. A serious attempt must be made to execute health interventions and health advices, based on evidence gathered using these methods and other social science approaches."

Q954,How does the incubation period for measles vary?,The incubation period for measles is 7 to 18 days from exposure to the onset of fever.,TG Booklet 6,226,"Measles Incubation Period, Exposure, Onset, Fever","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 839, Content: By looking only at the number of reported cases, it appears that a higher occurrence of measles cases occurred in health facility A. But when the number of reported cases at each health facility is compared to the total number of school-aged children living in each catchment area, then the situation becomes clearer.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 841, Content: By calculating the incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of measles cases during the last 12 months in school-aged children. The numerator is the number of new cases that occurred over one year. The denominator is the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The measure obtained is called incidence rate or attack rate.  In this example, the incidence rate is higher in health facility B than in health facility A. The IDSR focal person can compare the impact of the illness on each facility. The facility In-charge/IDSR focal person can also use similar analysis to compare illnesses in different villages."

Q894,What are the criteria for a suspected and confirmed case of lymphatic filariasis?,"A suspected case is a resident with hydrocoele or lymphoedema, excluding other causes. A confirmed case has positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia, filarial antigenaemia, or positive ultrasound test.",TG Booklet 6,204,"Case Definition, Lymphatic Filariasis, Suspected Case, Hydrocoele, Lymphoedema, Confirmed Case, Laboratory Diagnosis, Microfilaremia, Filarial Antigenaemia, Ultrasound","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 203, Content: Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occurTreatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timoriModes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.Clinical description:Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).Chronic complications include:Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbsDamage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central levelSentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded.Confirmed case:A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case managementHygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis:Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and waterRaising the affected limb at nightExercising to promote lymph flowKeeping nails short and cleanWearing comfortable footwearUsing antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics.For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed:In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose.In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision.The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 yearsAreas with no concurrent OnchocerciasisDiethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, orDiethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administrationAnalyse the drug coverage in implementation unitsAssess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smearFilarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 243, Content: Background﷐Filarial infection of the skin and eye caused by Onchocerca volvulus transmitted by the bite of female Simulium black flies.Nearly all of the world’s estimated 18 million infected persons (of whom more than 250 000 are blind) live within 26 African countries. Onchocerciasis is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It causes debilitating skin problems, leading to significant decreases in productivity in areas where it is endemic. Entire villages have relocated away from the fertile lands near rivers where black flies breed.Incubation period is years to decades since repeated infection is necessary for disease manifestations.

Q765,What criteria are included in the standard case definition for Chikungunya?,"The standard case definition for Chikungunya includes clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria for acute clinical, atypical, and severe acute cases.",TG Booklet 6,155,Chikungunya: Criteria In Case Definition,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths. Report summary totals monthly.  During outbreak, count cases and deaths weekly. Analyse by age. Assess risk factors to improve     prevention of outbreaks.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Chikungunya﷐Diagnostic test﷐Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus; the virus may be isolated from the blood of acutely ill patients in newborn mice, mosquitoes or cell culture or detected using IFA or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case (s). Suspected CHIK cases occur in clusters.Collect representative specimens from suspected cases. If outbreak is confirmed, collect more specimens from cases and also mosquitoes from the affected homes for testing.Type of Specimen:-Acute-phase blood (0-10 days after onset)-Convalescent-phase blood (7 - 21 days after onset)Time of collection:When patient presents; collect second sample during convalescence. Between days 7 and 21 after onset.﷐How to prepare,store, and transport the specimen﷐Transport of specimens should comply with the WHO guidelines for the safe transport of infectious substances and diagnostic specimens (WHO, 1997).For ELISA:Refrigerate at 2º to 8º C serum or clot for testing within 24 hour. If kept for longer store at -80ºC.For virus isolation and RT_PCRStore frozen at -20ºC for short-term storage or at -70ºC or transport in fully charged dry shipper.Mosquitoes for testing should be transported in fully charged dry shipper. Focus onAedes species﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for Chikungunya are not routinely available. Contact the appropriate National authority or WHO.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 146, Content: A standard case definition is an agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected disease or condition. The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and specifications on time, place and person. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 297, Content: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time."

However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead in coordinating and implementing outbreak response activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 227, Content: Outbreak preparedness is paramount given the heightened risk of disease outbreaks in crisis affected populations. Preparedness efforts should as much as possible be integrated in the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the Ministry of Health leading the efforts and supported by WHO and partners. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead to enhance outbreak preparedness (WHO, 2012). The key preparedness efforts in crisis affected populations should entail the following: 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 504, Content: Rapid and effective response to a public health emergency such as a suspected outbreak or other public health event not only calls for an immediate response but is also one of the core capacities required by International Health Regulations 2005. Being prepared to detect and respond to such an event is an essential role of the district and national levels. "
Q1231,Who should ensure the completeness of reporting and what steps can be taken to improve it?,"Health facilities and surveillance focal points should ensure the completeness of reporting. Steps to improve completeness include conducting trend analyses, investigating reasons for poor performance, and identifying solutions to correct poor performance.",TG Booklet 4,229-232,"Completeness Assurance, Reporting, Health Facilities, Surveillance Focal Points, Trend Analyses, Poor Performance Investigation, Solution Identification","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 212, Content: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Background﷐Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are transmitted from person-to-person via faecal-oral spread.Incubation period is 7 to 14 days for paralytic cases and the range is approximately 3 to 35 days. The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons.Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg.Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong.Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals.The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine. Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission.Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases.

Q675,What are the common sources of epidemics for enterically transmitted viral hepatitis A and E?,Contaminated water and contamination via infected food handlers.,TG Booklet 6,125,Contaminated Water And Contamination Via Infected Food Handlers.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q978,What is Monkeypox?,"Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease with a similar but milder presentation than smallpox.",TG Booklet 6,230,"Monkeypox Definition, Viral Disease, Zoonotic, Orthopoxvirus, Smallpox-like Presentation","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 230, Content: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 278, Content: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox."
Q1128,When should IDSR be enhanced during emergencies?,IDSR should be enhanced within 3-10 days of grading the public health emergency to facilitate rapid detection and response to disease outbreaks and public health events.,TG Booklet 5,99,"IDSR Enhancement, Emergencies, 3-10 Days, Rapid Detection, Response, Disease Outbreaks, Public Health Events","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 99, Content: During emergencies, populations are more vulnerable to morbidity, mortality and disability resulting from endemic and epidemic prone diseases. Thus, IDSR should be enhanced within 3-10 days of grading the public health emergency to facilitate rapid detection and response to disease outbreaks and public health events (WHO, 2009). Ultimately, this will contribute to the overall goal of reducing avoidable mortality, morbidity, and disability during humanitarian crises (WHO, 2009b). 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 84, Content: In these settings, an Enhanced IDSR system should be established to address the humanitarian emergency. The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs."

Q916,"When should an alert be triggered for malnutrition in children, and what action should be taken?","An alert should be triggered if more than 20% of children are underweight, and further investigation should be conducted, with referral to a therapeutic feeding program for cases with MUAC less than 11.5 cm.",TG Booklet 6,221,"Malnutrition Alert Trigger, Children Underweight Percentage, Further Investigation, Therapeutic Feeding Program Referral, MUAC Criteria","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Q459,What role does the District log of suspected outbreaks and alerts play in maintaining a systematic record of outbreak-related information?,"The log serves as a systematic record by capturing details about suspected outbreaks, alerts, or unexplained events. It includes relevant data such as disease information, reported cases and deaths, investigation results, intervention details, and notifications. This systematic record facilitates tracking and analysis, enabling health authorities to make informed decisions, evaluate the outbreak response, and learn from the experience for future preparedness and response activities.",TG Booklet 3,411,"District Log, Systematic Record, Outbreak-related Information, Disease Data, Cases, Deaths, Interventions, Tracking, Analysis","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 214, Content: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level.

Q933,What is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa. Unattended births, especially in rural areas with transportation challenges, pose a particular risk.",TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Death Cause, Sub-saharan Africa, Hemorrhage, Unattended Births, Rural Areas, Transportation Challenges","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Q1032,What is the surveillance goal for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in the context of polio eradication?,"The goal is immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases, weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance, and detection of AFP cases for laboratory confirmation to achieve polio eradication.",TG Booklet 6,259,"Acute Flaccid Paralysis Surveillance, Polio Eradication, Case-based Reporting, Laboratory Confirmation","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Background﷐Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are transmitted from person-to-person via faecal-oral spread.Incubation period is 7 to 14 days for paralytic cases and the range is approximately 3 to 35 days. The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons.Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg.Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong.Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals.The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine. Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission.Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Obtain two or more stool specimens within 14 days of the onset of paralysis for viral isolation.Surveillance for AFP is used to capture all true cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Target for surveillance performance to provide certification of polio eradications is 1 case of AFP per year per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years.The ultimate objective of AFP surveillance is the eradication of the poliovirus.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any child under 15 years of age with acute flaccid paralysis or any person with paralytic illness at any age in whom the clinician suspects poliomyelitis.Confirmed case: A suspected case with virus isolation in stool.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 106, Content: Several activities are combined into one integrated activity, and take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target populations. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) often address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) or any unusual events. Thus, health workers who routinely visit health facilities to search for AFP cases also review district and health facility records for information about other priority diseases in the area. HSAs interact with their community members on a regular basis and ask about a range of diseases, conditions and events; communities know they can bring anything unusual to the attention of their focal persons, or through their VHCs.

Q896,"What is the current strategy for controlling lymphatic filariasis, and what treatment regimen is recommended?","Control involves anti-parasitic measures with yearly, 1-dose regimen. The regimen varies based on concurrent onchocerciasis. Educational efforts on compliance during mass chemotherapy are crucial.",TG Booklet 6,204,"Control Strategy, Lymphatic Filariasis, Anti-parasitic Measures, Yearly Regimen, Onchocerciasis Consideration, Educational Efforts, Mass Chemotherapy Compliance","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 203, Content: Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occurTreatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timoriModes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.Clinical description:Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).Chronic complications include:Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbsDamage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central levelSentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded.Confirmed case:A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case managementHygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis:Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and waterRaising the affected limb at nightExercising to promote lymph flowKeeping nails short and cleanWearing comfortable footwearUsing antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics.For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed:In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose.In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision.The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 yearsAreas with no concurrent OnchocerciasisDiethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, orDiethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administrationAnalyse the drug coverage in implementation unitsAssess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smearFilarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time.

Q764,How is Chikungunya classified based on the standard case definition?,"Chikungunya is classified into acute clinical, atypical, severe acute, and suspected and confirmed chronic cases based on the standard case definition.",TG Booklet 6,155,Chikungunya Classification: Case Definition,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

That person is counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 116, Content: During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes.

The text does not provide specific information on the incubation period for Chikungunya.",TG Booklet 6,"157, 154",Incubation Periods: Cholera Vs. Chikungunya,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths. Report summary totals monthly.  During outbreak, count cases and deaths weekly. Analyse by age. Assess risk factors to improve     prevention of outbreaks.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Chikungunya﷐Diagnostic test﷐Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus; the virus may be isolated from the blood of acutely ill patients in newborn mice, mosquitoes or cell culture or detected using IFA or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case (s). Suspected CHIK cases occur in clusters.Collect representative specimens from suspected cases. If outbreak is confirmed, collect more specimens from cases and also mosquitoes from the affected homes for testing.Type of Specimen:-Acute-phase blood (0-10 days after onset)-Convalescent-phase blood (7 - 21 days after onset)Time of collection:When patient presents; collect second sample during convalescence. Between days 7 and 21 after onset.﷐How to prepare,store, and transport the specimen﷐Transport of specimens should comply with the WHO guidelines for the safe transport of infectious substances and diagnostic specimens (WHO, 1997).For ELISA:Refrigerate at 2º to 8º C serum or clot for testing within 24 hour. If kept for longer store at -80ºC.For virus isolation and RT_PCRStore frozen at -20ºC for short-term storage or at -70ºC or transport in fully charged dry shipper.Mosquitoes for testing should be transported in fully charged dry shipper. Focus onAedes species﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for Chikungunya are not routinely available. Contact the appropriate National authority or WHO. Ministry of Health, Disease Outbreak Management Unit should send samples to WHO reference labs e.g. KEMRIPreliminary results are ready within 24 hours after samples arrive in the laboratory.Confirmatory results are ready within a week from sample reception.

Q1102,With what countries does Malawi establish a cross-border framework for disease control?,"Malawi has established a cross-border framework with its neighboring countries, Zambia, Mozambique, and Tanzania, to enhance compliance and build core capacities.",TG Booklet 1,158,"Malawi, Cross-border Framework, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: Given the ecological distribution of communicable diseases and the porosity of international borders, it is imperative that countries in the region work together to control and contain them.  The free movement of people and goods across the borders within the region provides opportunities for cross-border spread of diseases. In addition, in the urban centres located at border points a disaster on one side of the border can easily affect the health of a large number of people on both sides of the borders. It is therefore logical that countries in the region engage each other in coordinated and synchronized implementation of interventions so as to control the communicable diseases in the region. Developing cross-border framework will therefore provide an opportunity for countries to initiate and strengthen priority cross-border activities for disease control, including but not limited to disease surveillance, epidemic preparedness and outbreak control as well as building core capacities to ensure compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005). Malawi has since established cross-border framework with its neighbouring countries Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and will work on the following to enhance compliance and build the core capacities

Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 50, Content: In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.

Q925,What actions should be taken in response to an alert threshold related to malnutrition in children?,"Emphasis on breastfeeding support, nutrition education, supplementation of child and mother, prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, prevention and treatment of severe malnutrition, and socio-economic support.",TG Booklet 6,221,"Malnutrition Alert Threshold Response, Breastfeeding Support, Nutrition Education, Child And Mother Supplementation, Diarrhoea Prevention, Treatment, Severe Malnutrition Prevention, Treatment, Socio-economic Support","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women"
Q836,"What are the differences in the surveillance goals for Chikungunya, diabetes, and Diarrhoea with blood (Shigella), and why is it important to monitor antimicrobial resistance during outbreaks of bacterial origin in Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age?","Surveillance goals differ among diseases, with specific emphasis on detecting and responding to outbreaks. Monitoring antimicrobial resistance in bacterial outbreaks is crucial for effective treatment strategies. The goals align with the varied nature and impacts of these diseases on public health.",TG Booklet 6,"154, 165, 167, 172","Surveillance Goals For Chikungunya, Diabetes, Shigella","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread.Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year.Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens.The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly.

Q787,"Why are reactive mass vaccination campaigns conducted during Bacterial Meningitis epidemics, and how effective are polysaccharide vaccines in preventing the diseases?","Reactive mass vaccination campaigns for Bacterial Meningitis aim to control outbreaks and are conducted with polysaccharide vaccines. The MenAfriVac vaccine has been effective in reducing the circulation of Nm A and eliminating Nm A epidemics, conferring long-term protection.",TG Booklet 6,142,Reactive Vaccination: Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

Q773,Contrast the modes of transmission for Chikungunya and Bacterial Meningitis.,"Chikungunya is transmitted through mosquito bites, while Bacterial Meningitis is transmitted via large respiratory droplets from infected individuals.",TG Booklet 6,"154, 142",Modes Of Transmission: Chikungunya Vs. Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility."
Q732,Compare the transmission modes of bacterial meningitis and anthrax.,"Bacterial meningitis is transmitted via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people. Anthrax, on the other hand, is transmitted from infected domestic livestock or wild game animals to humans through direct or indirect contact with animals or their products.",TG Booklet 6,"143, 135",Transmission Modes: Bacterial Meningitis Vs. Anthrax,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes

Q980,What is the primary animal reservoir for the Monkeypox virus?,"The primary animal reservoir is unknown, but it has been detected in small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys.",TG Booklet 6,230,"Monkeypox Animal Reservoir, Unknown, Detection, Small Mammals, Rodents, Monkeys","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 230, Content: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 278, Content: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1883, Content: We do not know the answer to this question yet, because we do not know the source of exposure for these human infections. However, analysis of the genes of these viruses suggests that although they have evolved from avian (bird) viruses, they show signs of adaption to growth in mammalian species. These adaptations include an ability to bind to mammalian cells, and to grow at temperatures close to the normal body temperature of mammals (which is lower than that of birds)."

Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Q970,"How is MERS transmitted to humans, and what is the role of dromedary camels?","Humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels, the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. The exact route of transmission is unknown, and the virus does not easily pass from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact.",TG Booklet 6,228,"MERS Transmission, Humans, Dromedary Camels, Reservoir Host, Contact, Virus Transmission Route, Person-to-person Contact","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1883, Content: We do not know the answer to this question yet, because we do not know the source of exposure for these human infections. However, analysis of the genes of these viruses suggests that although they have evolved from avian (bird) viruses, they show signs of adaption to growth in mammalian species. These adaptations include an ability to bind to mammalian cells, and to grow at temperatures close to the normal body temperature of mammals (which is lower than that of birds).
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 511, Content: Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS‐CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS‐CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a MERS‐CoV patient.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 263, Content: Background﷐Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. Rabies infects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infected saliva (via bites or scratches).The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, eventually, death. Early symptoms in people include: fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the diseaseprogresses,symptomsinclude;insomnia,anxiety,confusion,slightorpartialparalysis,excitable behaviour, hallucinations, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water.In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered before the onset of severe symptoms. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of neurological symptoms.Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Africa and are responsible for most (approximately 97%) of the human rabies deaths worldwide.WHO estimates approximately 55,000 human deaths worldwide due to rabies each year; in Africa the annual death toll is 24,000.People most at risk of rabies live in rural areas, and children are at highest risk of dog rabies. About 30% to 60% of the victims of dog bites (the primary mode of virus transmission) are children less than 15 years of age. Children often play with animals and are less likely to report bites or scratches.Control of rabies in dog populations and access to human rabies post exposure prophylaxis can substantially reduce the burden of rabies in human populationsRapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of rabies.Identify high-risk areasEstimation of disease burdenImmediate reporting of cases and routine monthly summary reports﷐Standard case definition﷐SuspectedA person with one or more of the following: headache, neck pain, nausea, fever, fear of water, anxiety, agitation, abnormal tingling sensations or pain at the wound site, when contact with a rabid animal is suspected.ConfirmedA suspected case that is laboratory confirmed﷐Recommended Public Health Action: Rabies (Human)﷐For a single case:Post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabiesIsolate patient if rabies develops to prevent infection of othersImmunize contacts if patient develops rabiesVaccinate local dogs and cats to prevent outbreaksGeneral preventive measures:Promote public awareness of rabiesTarget immunization campaign for domestic or wild animals in high-risk areasMaintain active surveillance of rabies in animals﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Plot cases monthly.Place:Plot the location of case households and animal exposures.Person:Analyse distribution of cases by age, exposing animal, and circumstances of infection. Assess riskfactors to improve control of cases﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Diagnostic test﷐Detection of rabies viral antigens by direct fluorescent antibody (FA) in clinical specimens, preferably brain tissue (collected post mortem)Detection by FA on skin or corneal smear (collected ante mortem)FA positive after inoculation or brain tissue, saliva or CSF in cell culture, in mice or in suckling miceDetectable rabies-neutralizing antibody titre in the CSF of an unvaccinated personIdentification of viral nucleic acid by reverse transcriptase PCR on fixed tissue collected post mortem or in a clinical specimen (brain tissue or skin, cornea or saliva)Isolation of rabies virus from clinical specimens and confirmation of rabies viral antigens by direct FA testing.﷐Specimen﷐Brain tissue (collected post mortem)Skin biopsy (usually from the neck)CornealSalivaCSFHead of suspected rabid animal (dogs)﷐When to collect the specimen﷐When a person is bitten by a pet that appears sick or by a wild animal, the biggest concern is rabies. No test can determine whether the rabies virus has been transmitted to the person immediately after the bite. So, the animal is evaluated to determine whether the person requires treatment. A wild animal that has bitten a person is killed if possible, so that its brain can be examined.If a person who has been bitten by an animal becomes increasingly confused and agitated or paralyzed, the diagnosis is probably rabies. At this point, tests can detect the rabies virus.Post mortem: within 4-6hrs after death of patient, as soon as the suspected animal dies or is killed﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen﷐Safety precautions in handling rabies virus should be taken to avoid infection.Remove the head of the suspected animal, wrap head completely such that no blood is oozing out. Where possible, request a veterinarian to assist in the collection and preservation of the specimen.Sample should be sent to Reference Laboratory for Rabies virus.﷐Results﷐The treatment should never await the results of laboratory diagnosis. A laboratory diagnosis may be delayed for a variety of reasons. Results can be obtained from the reference lab within 1-2days.﷐Reference: Rabies (Human)﷐WHO Recommended Surveillance Standards.

Q910,What are the major determinants of malnutrition?,"Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections.",TG Booklet 6,220,"Malnutrition Determinants, Socio-economic Conditions, Water And Sanitation, Mothers’ Nutritional Education, Feeding Babies, Young Children, Repeated Infections","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 165, Content: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the diseaseMonitor trends and risk factorsIdentify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural)Monitor prevention and control program activities"

Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 187, Content: Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 289, Content: Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness.Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually. In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers.Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection.Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries.People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months.Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread.

Q956,"Why does measles have a high transmission rate, and when do large outbreaks occur?",Measles is among the most transmissible human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of individuals who have never been infected or vaccinated.,TG Booklet 6,226,"Measles Transmission Rate, Large Outbreaks, Low Vaccine Coverage, Susceptible Individuals","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 839, Content: By looking only at the number of reported cases, it appears that a higher occurrence of measles cases occurred in health facility A. But when the number of reported cases at each health facility is compared to the total number of school-aged children living in each catchment area, then the situation becomes clearer.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible.Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is confirmed:Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage.Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths. Construct epidemic curve for outbreak cases.Place:Plot location of case households.Person: Count total cases and analyse by age group and immunization status.﷐Laboratory confirmationDiagnostic test: Presence of IgM antibodies to measles virus in serum.﷐Specimen: SerumWhole blood, gingival fluid, throat swab﷐When to collect the specimenCollect specimens between the 3rd day of the rash and 28th day after onset of rash.Collect blood samples on 5 suspected measles cases when the number of cases exceeds the measles outbreak threshold (usually more than 5 cases in a district in a month).In countries with an elimination target:Collect specimen from every suspected case of measlesCollect serum for antibody testing at first opportunity or first visit to the health facility﷐How to prepare, store and manage the specimen For children, collect 1 to 5 ml of venous blood depending on size of child. Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 841, Content: By calculating the incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of measles cases during the last 12 months in school-aged children. The numerator is the number of new cases that occurred over one year. The denominator is the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The measure obtained is called incidence rate or attack rate.  In this example, the incidence rate is higher in health facility B than in health facility A. The IDSR focal person can compare the impact of the illness on each facility. The facility In-charge/IDSR focal person can also use similar analysis to compare illnesses in different villages."

Q918,Why does severe malnutrition contribute to child mortality?,It may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.,TG Booklet 6,220,"Severe Malnutrition, Child Mortality, Direct Cause Of Death, Indirect Cause, Childhood Illnesses, Diarrhoea, Pneumonia","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 172, Content: Background﷐Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age is due to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viruses (especially Rotavirus), bacteria (E. coli, Salmonellae, Shigellae, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and others), and parasites (Giardia, Entamoeba, cryptosporidia, and cyclospora). These diseases are transmitted through eating contaminated food or water, or through faecal-oral spread.Diarrhoeal diseases represent the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age in many African countries, with more than 3 million deaths per year.Different epidemiological patterns (for example, seasonality) are observed for different pathogens.The WHO and UNICEF advocate that each district team use the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality of childhood diarrhoea.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect diarrhoea outbreaks promptly. Laboratory confirmation can confirm specific pathogenic agent outbreak, but laboratory confirmation is not necessary for routine surveillance of diarrhoea with dehydration.Monitor antimicrobial resistance during outbreaks of bacterial origin.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools in the past 24 hours with or without dehydration and:Some dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: restlessness, irritability; sunken eyes; thirsty; skin pinch goes back slowly, orSevere dehydration -- two or more of the following signs: lethargy or unconsciousness; sunken eyes; not able to drink or drinking poorly; skin pinch goes back very slowly.Confirmed case:Suspected case confirmed with stool culture for a known enteric pathogen.

Q843,What is the standard case definition for Chikungunya?,The standard case definition for Chikungunya includes the presence of acute fever and severe arthralgia.,TG Booklet 6,154,Standard Case Definition For Chikungunya,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths.

Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 116, Content: During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes."

Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation:Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb].Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case;Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other settingProbable case:  A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human.Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed casec Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.   d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests.

Q850,What is the standard case definition for Ebola or Marburg virus diseases in routine surveillance?,"The standard case definition for routine surveillance of Ebola or Marburg virus diseases includes suspected cases with fever and signs such as bloody diarrhea or bleeding, and confirmed cases with laboratory verification or epidemiologic links.",TG Booklet 6,180,Standard Case Definition For Ebola Or Marburg,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 180, Content: Background﷐The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses.Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo.More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007).These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented.Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved.Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures.Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days.Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses.High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%)There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes.Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used.Prevention efforts such as social distancing and vaccination should be supported. Monitoring case fatalities, assess spread of illness (chains of transmission), and death. Guide the support and care of survivors﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Routine Surveillance:Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.Community-based surveillance: Alert case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area; ORAt least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine; ORAny sudden death Actions to take: If an alert case (living or dead) is identified, report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre This definition of “alert cases” for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local eventIn outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions may guide appropriate detection of cases:Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal (for Ebola) - a mine (for Marburg) ORAny person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding;  OR Any sudden, inexplicable death; ORA person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal (for Ebola); a mine (for Marburg) ﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Note: During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms, therefore, the case definition for suspected or confirmed case does not include it. Probable case: Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician; OR Any deceased suspected case (where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation) having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case Note: if laboratory specimens are collected in due time during the illness, the preceding categories are reclassified as “laboratory confirmed” cases and “non-case”.Laboratory confirmed case: Any suspected or probably cases with a positive laboratory result for virus presence. Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Marburg or Ebola virus. Non-Case: Any suspected or probable case with negative laboratory results. “Non-case” showed no specific antibodies, RNA or specific detectable antigens﷐Respond to alert threshold: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐If a single case is suspected:If a single case is suspected: Report case-based information immediately (phone or text with information from generic case investigation form) to the appropriate authorities. Collect specimen to confirm the case(s). Carefully complete specimen request form and mark containers to warn laboratory of risk. Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier nursing techniques implemented. Eliminate body fluid exposure and wear VHF appropriate PPE.

Low risk contacts under daily follow-up should be encouraged to limit their movementsBegin surveillance and screening of dead bodies including: any individual aged 5 years or more, dying within 14 days of symptom onset from an indeterminate cause, OR still births.) Treat accompanying similar symptoms, in particular malaria, typhoid, fever, louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Implement IPC measures and avoid nosocomial transmission by strict implementation of barrier nursing. If barrier nursing material is not available, avoid any invasive procedure (e.g. blood sampling, injections, placement of infusion lines, or nasogastric tubes) and put on at least one layer of gloves for any direct contact with the patient; double gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that poses an increased risk for blood exposure. There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. For EVD, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available.  However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.﷐When to collect﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case.If more than one suspected case, collect until specimens have been collected from 5 to10 suspected cases.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret.

Q858,What are the results of diagnostic services for viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola or Marburg?,"Diagnostic services for viral hemorrhagic fevers are not routinely available, and advance arrangements are usually required. Contacting the appropriate national authority or the World Health Organization (WHO) is necessary for arranging diagnostic services.",TG Booklet 6,180,"Diagnostic Services, Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, Advance Arrangements, National Authority, WHO","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 180, Content: Background﷐The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses.Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo.More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007).These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented.Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved.Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures.Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days.Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses.High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%)There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes.Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.﷐Surveillance goals﷐Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used.Prevention efforts such as social distancing and vaccination should be supported. Monitoring case fatalities, assess spread of illness (chains of transmission), and death. Guide the support and care of survivors﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Routine Surveillance:Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.Community-based surveillance: Alert case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area; ORAt least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine; ORAny sudden death Actions to take: If an alert case (living or dead) is identified, report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre This definition of “alert cases” for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local eventIn outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions may guide appropriate detection of cases:Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal (for Ebola) - a mine (for Marburg) ORAny person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding;  OR Any sudden, inexplicable death; ORA person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal (for Ebola); a mine (for Marburg) ﷐Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Note: During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms, therefore, the case definition for suspected or confirmed case does not include it. Probable case: Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician; OR Any deceased suspected case (where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation) having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case Note: if laboratory specimens are collected in due time during the illness, the preceding categories are reclassified as “laboratory confirmed” cases and “non-case”.Laboratory confirmed case: Any suspected or probably cases with a positive laboratory result for virus presence. Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Marburg or Ebola virus. Non-Case: Any suspected or probable case with negative laboratory results. “Non-case” showed no specific antibodies, RNA or specific detectable antigens﷐Respond to alert threshold: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐If a single case is suspected:If a single case is suspected: Report case-based information immediately (phone or text with information from generic case investigation form) to the appropriate authorities. Collect specimen to confirm the case(s). Carefully complete specimen request form and mark containers to warn laboratory of risk. Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier nursing techniques implemented. Eliminate body fluid exposure and wear VHF appropriate PPE.

Begin screening procedures for fever and VHF-like symptoms at the entrances to health care facilities with hand washing Request additional help from other levels as needed.Establish isolation ward to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre. Ensure there is a barrier between suspected cases and confirmed cases in an isolation unit.Quarantine high-risk contacts with home support during the incubation period. Low risk contacts under daily follow-up should be encouraged to limit their movementsBegin surveillance and screening of dead bodies including: any individual aged 5 years or more, dying within 14 days of symptom onset from an indeterminate cause, OR still births.) Treat accompanying similar symptoms, in particular malaria, typhoid, fever, louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Implement IPC measures and avoid nosocomial transmission by strict implementation of barrier nursing. If barrier nursing material is not available, avoid any invasive procedure (e.g. blood sampling, injections, placement of infusion lines, or nasogastric tubes) and put on at least one layer of gloves for any direct contact with the patient; double gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that poses an increased risk for blood exposure. There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. For EVD, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely:
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 116, Content: During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies."

IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.

(NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Hepatitis C: Parenteral Exposure To Blood, Major Causes Include Unscreened Blood Transfusions And Re-use Of Inadequately Sterilized Needles.","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q926,"When should an alert be triggered for malnutrition in children, and what action should be taken?","An alert should be triggered if more than 20% of children are underweight, and further investigation should be conducted, with referral to a therapeutic feeding program for cases with MUAC less than 11.5 cm.",TG Booklet 6,221,"Malnutrition Alert Trigger, Children Underweight Percentage, Further Investigation, Therapeutic Feeding Program Referral, MUAC Criteria","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 706, Content: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. "

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 165, Content: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the diseaseMonitor trends and risk factorsIdentify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural)Monitor prevention and control program activities
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age. Please see Diarrhoea with dehydration summary guidelines.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea. To confirm an outbreak, collect and transport stool specimens transported in Cary-Blair medium.Do immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths when an outbreak is suspected."

Q680,"How is chronic hepatitis C infection transmitted, and what are the risk factors?",Transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood; major causes include use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of inadequately sterilized needles.,TG Booklet 6,125,Transmitted By Parenteral Exposure To Blood; Major Causes Include Use Of Unscreened Blood Transfusions And Re-use Of Inadequately Sterilized Needles.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q336,What steps should be taken if laboratory testing is required to confirm a disease during an outbreak investigation?,"Refer to the laboratory requirements in Section 11.0 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines to determine the diagnostic test, specimen, and collection procedures.",TG Booklet 3,292,"Laboratory Testing, Outbreak Investigation, Diagnostic Test, Specimen, Collection Procedures, Section 11.0, IDSR Guidelines","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 187, Content: Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: If the disease can be confirmed by laboratory testing, refer to the laboratory requirements in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines to determine the diagnostic test and the specimen that is required. The disease specific laboratory requirements also describe how to collect, store and transport the relevant specimen, and how many specimens to collect to confirm an outbreak for that particular disease. Some samples using a triple package technique (See Annex 4H). Note that some diseases may require additional food or environmental samples to aid in diagnosis and ensure that these samples are also collected e.g. water and food samples for water borne and food borne outbreaks respectively.

Q548,Does the TG contain case definitions for Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths?,"Yes, Page 140 of TG Booklet 6 Section 11",TG Booklet 6,51,"TG, Perinatal Deaths, Case Definitions, Page 140, Booklet 6, Section 11","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 246, Content: Standard case definitions: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Perinatal death includes the death of a baby of at least 28 weeks of gestation and/or 1,000 g in weight and early neonatal death (the first seven days after birth)A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 g birthweight and/or at least 28 weeks gestation and 35 cm long. Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life. Day 1 is clinically considered the first day of life.  Late neonatal death is defined as any death of live newborn occurring days 8 through 28 after birth. ﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐After determining that a perinatal death has occurred, the initial notification should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility or the district perinatal death review committee is required to review the case within seven (7) days PDR should be anonymous. It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicableThe reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation ﷐Recommended public health action﷐In many low-income countries, it is not possible to review all perinatal deaths given the large numbers of deaths and the limited capacity in human resources and time. However, it is important to accurately capture and classify the causes of those deathsSelected perinatal death should be reviewed and investigated to ascertain the cause.Surveillance for perinatal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where they occur.Response to any perinatal death is based on recommendations from the perinatal death review.Findings from review of the selected perinatal death should lead to actions to prevent similar deaths by identifying gaps that should be addressed at policy level and in both health facilities and communities.Monthly, quarterly or semi-annual analysis of aggregated data at larger health facilities and at district level  can lead to a more comprehensive approach  to address a particular problem across multiple facilities or communities or a problem in particular geographical areas where  they are occurring in greater numbers.  These should be conducted alongside those for maternal deaths by the MPDSR committee.﷐Analyse and interpret data: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths﷐Measures of magnitude Number of stillbirths (SBR)Number of early neonatal deaths (NMR)Causes of stillbirthsCauses of early neonatal deaths% of stillbirths and neonatal deaths due to avoidable factors Descriptive analysis by person, place and time:Gestational age at time of death,Socioeconomic status of family, educational levels of parents Time and date of death, weekday or weekend.

Q771,"What specific information, related to clinical aspects, specimen collection, risk factors, and treatment, is essential in the Chikungunya alert threshold response?","In the Chikungunya alert threshold response, essential information includes clinical details, specimen collection procedures, risk factors for transmission, and treatment measures.",TG Booklet 6,155,Chikungunya Alert Threshold: Essential Information,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths. Report summary totals monthly.  During outbreak, count cases and deaths weekly. Analyse by age. Assess risk factors to improve     prevention of outbreaks.﷐Laboratory confirmation: Chikungunya﷐Diagnostic test﷐Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus; the virus may be isolated from the blood of acutely ill patients in newborn mice, mosquitoes or cell culture or detected using IFA or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)﷐Specimen﷐Serum﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from the first suspected case (s). Suspected CHIK cases occur in clusters.Collect representative specimens from suspected cases. If outbreak is confirmed, collect more specimens from cases and also mosquitoes from the affected homes for testing.Type of Specimen:-Acute-phase blood (0-10 days after onset)-Convalescent-phase blood (7 - 21 days after onset)Time of collection:When patient presents; collect second sample during convalescence. Between days 7 and 21 after onset.﷐How to prepare,store, and transport the specimen﷐Transport of specimens should comply with the WHO guidelines for the safe transport of infectious substances and diagnostic specimens (WHO, 1997).For ELISA:Refrigerate at 2º to 8º C serum or clot for testing within 24 hour. If kept for longer store at -80ºC.For virus isolation and RT_PCRStore frozen at -20ºC for short-term storage or at -70ºC or transport in fully charged dry shipper.Mosquitoes for testing should be transported in fully charged dry shipper. Focus onAedes species﷐Results﷐Diagnostic services for Chikungunya are not routinely available. Contact the appropriate National authority or WHO. Ministry of Health, Disease Outbreak Management Unit should send samples to WHO reference labs e.g. KEMRIPreliminary results are ready within 24 hours after samples arrive in the laboratory.Confirmatory results are ready within a week from sample reception.

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 308, Content: The areas for the search may be influenced by the disease, its mode of transmission, and factors of risk related to time, place and person. Visit those places and talk to people who had, or were likely to have had, contact with the patient. Ask if they or anyone they know has had an illness or condition like the one being investigated. Find out if anyone else in the area around the case has been ill with signs or symptoms that meet the case definition. Find out if there were any recent deaths. If they say yes, find out what were the signs and symptoms of the person(s) that died. Enquire about the people that took care of these people when they were sick and also the preparation of the dead before and during the burial ceremony. Collect information that will help to describe the magnitude and geographic extent of the outbreak.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1857, Content: After an outbreak or event response has taken place, district staff who led the investigation should prepare a report. The purpose of the report is to document how the problem was identified, investigated, responded to, what the outcome was, decision taken and recommendations made. Make sure that the health unit that reported the initial cases receives a copy of the report. See Annex 7B and Annex 7D at the end of this section for an example of a recommended format and sample."
Q235,What aspects should be reviewed when assessing findings?,"When reviewing findings, one should assess whether the situation is improving or not, make comparisons of observed data to expected data, and consider possible explanations for an apparent increase in cases.",TG Booklet 2,905-908,"Findings Assessment, Situation Improvement, Observed Data, Expected Data, Case Increase Explanations","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 210, Content: Periodically the quality of the surveillance system should be assessed based on these attributes. Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 191, Content: Step 8 – Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve the surveillance system: Assess the effectiveness of the surveillance and response systems, in terms of timeliness, quality of information, preparedness, (thresholds, case management) and overall performance. Provide feedback to reinforce health workers’ efforts to participate in the surveillance system. Take action to correct problems and make improvements. Different evaluation procedures can be used such as After Action Review (AAR), Intra Action Review (IAR) Joint External Evaluation (JEE), Simulation Exercises (SIMEX), operational review etc. Community representatives, private sector NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral should be included in these evaluation activities. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 228, Content: It is crucial to improve collaboration between human and veterinary and other relevant public health laboratories in line with the One Health approach to meet the national surveillance goal. From human surveillance perspective, the local surveillance and the laboratory focal persons at each level of the health system should maintain an updated list of the laboratories that have the capacity to perform required laboratory testing. A sample worksheet for listing national laboratories for confirming priority diseases and conditions is in Annex 1G of this section.

For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease.

The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: Provide clear information to frontline staff about Why report unusual events? What events are reportable? How to report an unusual event? What happens after you report? Examples of event reporting:Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal. Detect cases. Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks."
Q141,What are the key aspects covered in Section 3 of Module 3 (Analyse and Interpret Data) of the guidelines?,"Section 3 of Module 3 covers the analysis and interpretation of data. It emphasizes the importance of not only collecting, recording, and reporting numerical information but also analyzing it at each level where it is collected. The analysis is crucial for observing trends over time, alerting health staff and stakeholders about emergent events or unusual patterns, identifying areas at higher risk, characterizing personal variables, and monitoring and evaluating public health interventions.",TG Booklet 2,730-736,"Analysis Plan, Routine Surveillance Information, Annex 3A","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 282, Content: Section 3: Analyse and interpret data

Q35,What defines a suspected case?,A suspected case will have fewer symptoms or atypical clinical features without confirmation or it is linked epidemiologically to a probable or confirmed case.,TG Booklet 2,154,"Suspected Case, Symptoms, Clinical Features, Epidemiologically, Probable Case, Confirmed Case.","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.

Q946,What actions are recommended for addressing maternal mortality? How do these actions contribute to reducing maternal deaths?,"Recommended actions include investigating every death of a woman of reproductive age, conducting surveillance in the community, and implementing evidence-based interventions. These actions contribute to reducing maternal deaths by improving coverage and quality of maternal health care services.",TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Mortality Addressing Actions, Investigation, Community Surveillance, Evidence-based Interventions, Maternal Health Care Service Improvement","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 499, Content: For conditions like maternal and perinatal deaths, the circumstances leading to the death need to be gathered and analysed and health providers should use the national Maternal Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) in consultation with the relevant focal points."
Q217,How does the response differ between the epidemic and alert thresholds for bacterial meningitis?,"The epidemic threshold signifies a more definitive response and may involve actions such as communicating laboratory confirmation, implementing emergency responses like immunization activities or community awareness campaigns. The alert threshold indicates that further investigation is needed, and actions may include confirming or clarifying the problem.",TG Booklet 2,888,"Epidemic Threshold, Alert Threshold, Bacterial Meningitis, Definitive Response, Emergency Responses, Investigation, Problem Clarification","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 888, Content: In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response.

Q206,Why is calculating the incidence of measles cases important?,"Calculating the incidence of measles cases is important because it allows for the assessment of the disease's impact over time in a specific population, particularly in school-aged children. The incidence is determined by calculating the number of new cases over the last 12 months, with the numerator representing these new cases and the denominator being the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The resulting measure, known as the incidence rate or attack rate, provides valuable information for comparing the impact of the illness in different facilities or villages. In the provided example, comparing the incidence rates helps the IDSR focal person evaluate and compare the impact of the illness between health facility A and health facility B, enabling informed decision-making for public health interventions.",TG Booklet 2,841,"Incidence, Measles Cases, Disease Impact, Population, School-aged Children, Incidence Rate, Attack Rate, IDSR, Public Health Interventions","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 841, Content: By calculating the incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of measles cases during the last 12 months in school-aged children. The numerator is the number of new cases that occurred over one year. The denominator is the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The measure obtained is called incidence rate or attack rate.  In this example, the incidence rate is higher in health facility B than in health facility A. The IDSR focal person can compare the impact of the illness on each facility. The facility In-charge/IDSR focal person can also use similar analysis to compare illnesses in different villages.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 839, Content: By looking only at the number of reported cases, it appears that a higher occurrence of measles cases occurred in health facility A. But when the number of reported cases at each health facility is compared to the total number of school-aged children living in each catchment area, then the situation becomes clearer.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible.Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is confirmed:Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage.Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths. Construct epidemic curve for outbreak cases.Place:Plot location of case households.Person: Count total cases and analyse by age group and immunization status.﷐Laboratory confirmationDiagnostic test: Presence of IgM antibodies to measles virus in serum.﷐Specimen: SerumWhole blood, gingival fluid, throat swab﷐When to collect the specimenCollect specimens between the 3rd day of the rash and 28th day after onset of rash.Collect blood samples on 5 suspected measles cases when the number of cases exceeds the measles outbreak threshold (usually more than 5 cases in a district in a month).In countries with an elimination target:Collect specimen from every suspected case of measlesCollect serum for antibody testing at first opportunity or first visit to the health facility﷐How to prepare, store and manage the specimen For children, collect 1 to 5 ml of venous blood depending on size of child. Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women"

Q1099,What activities does Malawi engage in with neighboring countries within the context of IDSR to control communicable diseases?,"Malawi engages in coordinated and synchronized implementation of interventions with neighboring countries to control communicable diseases. This includes cross-border surveillance, epidemic preparedness, outbreak control, and building core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations (IHR).",TG Booklet 1,158,"Malawi, Neighboring Countries, Communicable Diseases, Cross-border Surveillance, Epidemic Preparedness, Outbreak Control, IHR Compliance","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 102, Content: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998 as the approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national level. IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.

Q982,Which regions are at higher risk during Monkeypox outbreaks?,Household members and health care workers are at the highest risk during an outbreak.,TG Booklet 6,230,"Monkeypox Risk Regions, Household Members, Health Care Workers, Outbreak Risk","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 230, Content: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection. Use airborne isolation precautions where feasible.Investigate the case or outbreak to identify causes for outbreak.﷐Respond to action threshold: Measles﷐Measles outbreak/epidemic threshold in Malawi is reached when a minimum of 3 confirmed cases are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is confirmed:Improve routine vaccine coverage through the EPI, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage.Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day Age: 0-6mo=50,000IU, 7-11 mo = 100,000IU; ≥12mo=200,000IU﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph weekly cases and deaths. Construct epidemic curve for outbreak cases.Place:Plot location of case households.Person: Count total cases and analyse by age group and immunization status.﷐Laboratory confirmationDiagnostic test: Presence of IgM antibodies to measles virus in serum.﷐Specimen: SerumWhole blood, gingival fluid, throat swab﷐When to collect the specimenCollect specimens between the 3rd day of the rash and 28th day after onset of rash.Collect blood samples on 5 suspected measles cases when the number of cases exceeds the measles outbreak threshold (usually more than 5 cases in a district in a month).In countries with an elimination target:Collect specimen from every suspected case of measlesCollect serum for antibody testing at first opportunity or first visit to the health facility﷐How to prepare, store and manage the specimen For children, collect 1 to 5 ml of venous blood depending on size of child. Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

Q688,"Which viral hepatitis types are enterically transmitted, and what are their common sources of epidemics?",Enterically transmitted types: Hepatitis A (HAV) and Hepatitis E (HEV). Common sources: Contaminated water and infected food handlers.,TG Booklet 6,125,Enterically Transmitted Types: Hepatitis A (HAV) And Hepatitis E (HEV). Common Sources: Contaminated Water And Infected Food Handlers.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 558, Content: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito coils and repellents will help prevent mosquitoes from biting people﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during outbreaks.Place:Plot location of case households with precise mapping.Person:Report immediate case-based information for cases and deaths.

In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease.

Q1,What is public health surveillance?,"Public Health Surveillance involves systematically identifying, collecting, collating, analyzing, and interpreting disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action, ensuring the timely dissemination of resulting information for effective and appropriate action, and is essential for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating public health practice.",TG Booklet 1,72,"Public Health Surveillance, Identification, Collection, Analysis, Interpretation, Disease Occurrence, Public Health Events, Timely Action, Dissemination, Planning, Monitoring, Evaluating.","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 72, Content: Public Health Surveillance is the ongoing systematic identification, collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action. It includes the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those who need to know for effective and appropriate action. Surveillance is also essential for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health practice. Malawi has decided to achieve its public health surveillance objectives through the implementation of the IDSR strategy.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 121, Content: Surveillance priorities may be communicable and non-communicable diseases, conditions, or events that include national or local priorities such as acute outbreaks and deaths or events associated with human and/or animal health events which might have direct consequences to human health. An essential function of a public health surveillance system is to be vigilant in its capacity to detect not only known public health threats with established case definitions and formal reporting channels but also events or hazards that are not explicitly included in the formal reporting system. These may be events such as clusters of disease patterns or rumours of unexplained deaths.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 185, Content: ₋    Public health surveillance systems are only useful if they provide data for appropriate public health response and control. For an early warning system, the capacity to respond to detected outbreaks and emerging public health threats needs to be assessed. This can be done following a major outbreak response and containment to document the quality and impact of public health response and control. "
Q19,"Mention a feature of ""integrated surveillance"".","A feature of integrated surveillance is that several surveillance activities are integrated into one to take advantage of similar functions, skills, resources and target population. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Facial Paralysis (AFP) may also address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases.",TG Booklet 1,106,"Integrated Surveillance, Several Surveillance Activities, Functions, Skills, Resources, Target Population.","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 76, Content: Integrated Disease Surveillance: It is an approach that aims at collecting health data for multiple diseases using standardized tools. To ensure robust early warning and prompt response, the IDSR data collection and analysis system relies on two main channels of information or signal generation, namely: 1) Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) and 2) Event-Based Surveillance (EBS).
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 407, Content: Technical information on these risks can be obtained from various sources (See the references at the end).  Areas of interest for the purpose of capacity building of integrated surveillance should include partnerships to address the following:
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 69, Content: This section introduces the concepts of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), which incorporates indicator-based and event-based surveillance as integral parts of an Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS). The section also provides guidance on how IDSR works, the objectives of IDSR, and how IDSR can help to build and sustain the International Health Regulation (IHR) core capacities, thereby facilitating the implementation of IHR.  Furthermore, this section introduces other aspects such as; the One Health approach; the linkage between Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and IDSR; the core surveillance functions; how sub-national levels (for example districts) can use these guidelines to strengthen surveillance and response; the roles and responsibilities of the various actors at different levels; and finally, the priority diseases, conditions and events recommended in Malawi IDSR. "
Q280,"Why is it important to record reported outbreaks, public health events, and alerts?","Recording reported outbreaks, public health events, and alerts is crucial to track each suspected outbreak or event, ensuring a timely and effective response. This record, as mentioned in Section 4, helps in evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process.",TG Booklet 3,213-215,"Recording, Outbreaks, Public Health Events, Alerts, Tracking, Suspected Outbreak, Response, Evaluation","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 214, Content: Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: Provide clear information to frontline staff about Why report unusual events? What events are reportable? How to report an unusual event? What happens after you report? Examples of event reporting:Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal. Detect cases. Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.

Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 615, Content: A community-based surveillance (ComBaS) system relies on the community member’s capacity to identify and report public health problems to the nearest health facility or to the district health office. In this system, ComBaS focal persons identify and report events in the community that have public health significance. ComBaS focal persons act as community informants, and they report to the health facility, or in the case of a serious event, directly to the district authorities. The community health care workers may conduct the ComBaS using the integrated community health information system (iCHIS) as the reporting tool.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 200, Content: Any community member acceptable by the community can be a community-based surveillance (ComBaS) focal person. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of ComBaS. Representation could be from basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, human and animal health extension workers, chemical producer and seller, and traditional healers and in many communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper, security personnel who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.

During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaitedConfirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 163, Content: Background﷐﷐Dengue fever is an arbovirus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus). Dengue is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family.Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominately in urban and semi-urban areas. During dengue epidemics, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often 40% to 50%, but can reach 80% to 90%.Dengue fever is a severe, influenza-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death.Epidemic dengue activity in Africa has mostly been classical dengue fever caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2 without associated mortality. The first major outbreak of DENV-3 in Africa was documented in Mozambique in 1984-1985. During this outbreak, most patients experienced secondary infections and 2 deaths were attributed to DHF and shock. In 2008, yellow fever and DENV-3 were found to be co-circulating in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, however, no severe dengue cases or deaths attributable to dengue were identified.There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever.Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle. The virus circulates in the blood of infected human for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that they have a fever. A sylvatic transmission cycle has been documented in west Africa where DENV-2 has been found in monkeys. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.At present, the only method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes using environmental management and chemical methods.﷐﷐Surveillance goal﷐Surveillance for suspected cases and investigation of clusters of suspected cases in areas with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus mosquitoes﷐ Standard case definition: Dengue Fever﷐Dengue Fever Suspected case: Any person with acute febrile illness of 2-7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia.Dengue Fever Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titres, positive PCR or viral isolation).Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever: A probable or confirmed case of dengue with bleeding tendencies as evidenced by one or more of the following: positive tourniquet test; petechieae, ecchymoses or purpura; bleeding: mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other; haematemesis or melaena; and thrombocytopenia (100 000 cells or less per mm3) and evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex, 20% drop in haematocrit following volume replacement therapy compared to baseline, signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, hypo-proteinaemia).Dengue Shock Syndrome: All the above criteria, plus evidence of circulatory failure manifested by rapid and weak pulse, and narrow pulse pressure (≤ 20 mm Hg) or hypotension for age, cold, clammy skin and altered mental status.﷐﷐Respond to alert threshold: Dengue Fever﷐If a single case is suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next level.Conduct active search for additional casesCollect specimens for confirming the cases﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed:Report case-based information immediately to the next level and initiate a line list/register of suspected casesConduct active search for additional casesCollect specimens for confirming the cases and ensure results are linked with casesSurvey the community to determine the abundance of vector mosquitoes, identify the most productive larval habitats, promote and implement plans for their elimination, management or treatment with appropriate larvicides.Educate the public and promote behaviours to remove, destroy or manage mosquito vector larval habitats.Manage and provide supportive treatment to dengue fever cases.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content:  Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification. Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition﷐Acute clinical caseClinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    ORLaboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)Atypical caseClinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.Severe acute caseClinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalizationSuspected and confirmed chronic casesSuspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age       group).  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected:Report case-based information immediately to the next levelCollect specimens for confirming the casesConduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmissionManage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmedSymptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbsUse mosquito repellentsUse mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoesMosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are infected with Chikungunya.

Q911,What are the main causes of malnutrition according to the provided paragraphs?,"Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education, and repeated infections.",TG Booklet 6,220,"Malnutrition Causes, Socio-economic Conditions, Water Sanitation, Mothers’ Nutritional Education, Repeated Infections","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Q212,How does an ection (epidemic) threshold trigger a  response?,"The epidemic threshold triggers a response by marking the specific data or investigation finding that indicates the need for action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Once the epidemic threshold is reached, it signals a definite response. This response involves actions such as communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centers, implementing emergency responses like immunization activities, community awareness campaigns, or improved infection control practices in healthcare settings. The threshold serves as a clear signal that a situation requires specific actions to prevent the outbreak from worsening.",TG Booklet 2,887,"Epidemic Threshold, Response, Data, Investigation, Action, Laboratory Confirmation, Emergency Responses, Immunization, Community Awareness, Infection Control","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 500, Content: In IDSR, there are two types of thresholds used to initiate response: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. These thresholds are normally expressed in terms of the number (or proportion) of cases of a disease and the critical point (threshold) beyond which action must be taken. Trained health care personnel should always determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Statistical tools and methods may be applied to determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Thresholds for alerts and epidemic for epidemic prone diseases, conditions or events are shown in Section 11 of these  3rd Edition of the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines.

Q1138,How does early warning in stable contexts compare to early warning in humanitarian emergencies?,"In stable contexts, early warning focuses on routine surveillance and response mechanisms. In humanitarian emergencies, it demands enhanced surveillance for systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data to prevent excess morbidity, mortality, and disability due to acute public health threats.",TG Booklet 5,96-98,"Early Warning, Stable Contexts, Humanitarian Emergencies, Enhanced Surveillance, Systematic Data Collection, Acute Public Health Threats","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 508, Content: 4.     Early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events: Implementation of Early Warning and Response with a focus on Event-Based Surveillance.  WHO/HSE/GCR/LYO/2014.4

Q805,"What are the key components of the surveillance goal for Cholera, and why are they important?","Key components include detecting and responding promptly to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea, and seeking laboratory verification. They are important to focus on early case finding, proper management, and prevention of disabilities.",TG Booklet 6,"157, 158",Cholera Surveillance Goals,"Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs."
Q398,What information should be included in the conclusions section of an outbreak investigation report?,"The conclusions section should include the confirmation of the situation as an outbreak or public health problem, details on the population affected and at risk, place and time information, possible causes, laboratory results, source of infection, mode of transmission, attack rate, case fatality rate, and possible risk factors (366-369).",TG Booklet 3,366-369,"Conclusions, Outbreak Investigation Report, Confirmation, Population Affected, Risk, Causes, Laboratory Results, Source, Mode Of Transmission, Attack Rate, Case Fatality Rate, Risk Factors","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1857, Content: After an outbreak or event response has taken place, district staff who led the investigation should prepare a report.

Q689,Compare the estimated carrier numbers for hepatitis B and hepatitis C worldwide.,Hepatitis B: 257 million carriers; Hepatitis C: 71 million carriers.,TG Booklet 6,125,Hepatitis B: 257 Million Carriers; Hepatitis C: 71 Million Carriers.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q377,What is the purpose of conducting descriptive analysis of outbreak data?,Descriptive analysis helps generate hypotheses about the causes of observed patterns and factors increasing the risk for the outbreak.,TG Booklet 3,355,"Descriptive Analysis, Outbreak Data, Generate Hypotheses, Causes, Risk Factors","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 322, Content: The methods for analysing outbreak data are similar to how the analysis of summary data is described in Section 3. Data about the outbreak is analysed and re-analysed many times during the course of an outbreak."
Q691,"Where does the highest concentration of hepatitis C virus occur, and what are the major causes of HCV infection worldwide?",Highest concentration: In blood. Major causes: Use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of inadequately sterilized needles.,TG Booklet 6,125,Highest Concentration: In Blood. Major Causes: Use Of Unscreened Blood Transfusions And Re-use Of Inadequately Sterilized Needles.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q821,"What is the annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide, and why is it important to adopt resolutions and strategies to fight diabetes?","The annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million. Adopting resolutions and strategies is important to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes, raising awareness and implementing effective measures.",TG Booklet 6,165,Diabetes Annual Mortality Worldwide,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 165, Content: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the diseaseMonitor trends and risk factorsIdentify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural)Monitor prevention and control program activities
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 424, Content: Food and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing approximately 1.8 million people annually, most of whom are children.

Q80,Why is it important for every level of reporting of summaries / aggregate numbers to use a standard approach?,It is important for every level of reporting to use a standard approach to recording and reporting because data that are not comparable can lead to inappropriate decisions.,TG Booklet 2,600,"Importance Of Standard Approach, Recording, Reporting, Data Comparability, Inappropriate Decisions","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 569, Content: Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 600, Content: While each provider may have some preferred methods for filling in forms, describing diseases, or abbreviating terms, it is important for every level of reporting (Facility, district, national) to use a standard approach to recording and reporting, as data that are not comparable, will lead to inappropriate decisions.

The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 85, Content:  This section introduces key principles of implementing IDSR in complex humanitarian emergencies. This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events.

Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 706, Content: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. "
Q1142,How does the effectiveness of early warning systems in humanitarian emergencies compare to their effectiveness in non-emergency settings?,"In humanitarian emergencies, the effectiveness of early warning systems is critical to minimizing negative health consequences and is measured by the timeliness and quality of response to acute public health risks. In non-emergency settings, effectiveness is gauged by consistent monitoring and control of diseases, with less emphasis on rapid response.",TG Booklet 5,"97, 101","Effectiveness, Early Warning Systems, Humanitarian Emergencies, Non-emergency Settings, Health Consequences, Acute Public Health Risks, Consistent Monitoring, Rapid Response","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 87, Content: Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 85, Content:  This section introduces key principles of implementing IDSR in complex humanitarian emergencies. This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance, (WHO, 2014).
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 82, Content: Humanitarian emergencies  have major implications on the populations where they occur and on their health services including surveillance systems (WHO, 2012). Emergencies typically result in population displacement to congested settings where access to basic needs like water, food, shelter, and other social services are constrained. These conditions thus increase the risk of death from common epidemic and endemic diseases. "
Q91,Where can one find a list of key signs and symptoms to use in case definitions for community surveillance?,TG Booklet 2 Annex 1B provides a list of key signs and symptoms to use in case definitions for community surveillance.,TG Booklet 2,640,"Key Signs And Symptoms, Case Definitions, Community Surveillance, TG Booklet 2 Annex 1B","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 159, Content: Case definitions at the community level are usually simplified and are used to facilitate rapid detection of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 640, Content: Please refer to the list in Annex 1B of key signs and symptoms to use in case definitions for community surveillance.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 251, Content: Inform community leaders, religious leaders, community health workers, traditional healers, birth attendants, and health workers who conduct outreach activities in hard-to-reach areas about the priority diseases and conditions under surveillance in your area. Use key signs and symptoms of case definitions which have simple language and easier to understand than the IDSR health facility case definitions. The following are examples of some of selected case definitions which can be used to help the community to recognize the diseases and refer a person with these signs for treatment and notify the health facility."
Q723,"How does Anthrax transmission to humans occur, and what are the potential sources of infection?","Anthrax transmission to humans occurs through direct or indirect contact with infected domestic livestock or wild game animals. Sources of infection include handling infected carcasses, processing animal products, and consuming meat from sick animals.",TG Booklet 6,135,"Anthrax Human Transmission, Sources: Transmission Modes, Infection Sources","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1978, Content: Anthrax is an acute illness caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram positive, encapsulated, spore forming and none motile bacteria. The disease commonly affects wild and domestic herbivores, human and carnivores are incidental hosts. Three occurrence forms of the disease in human include cutaneous, inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. The transmission of the disease can be through intestine (ingestion), Respiratory (inhalation) and skin (cutaneous) from infected animal tissues and from infected person.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 2047, Content: The outbreak of Anthrax in Central Region was established through the laboratory confirmation from human case and the cattle. All the cases were linked to the dead cows making that a cause for an outbreak. Slaughtering and handling of meat to the dead cows were the major risk factors for acquiring the disease in human. The outbreak was declared over on 14th January 2016."
Q509,"How can close proximity to an initial case, as seen with the 30-year-old male nurse in the CCU, contribute to the transmission dynamics of a respiratory illness outbreak?","Close proximity increases the risk of exposure, allowing for the transmission of the respiratory illness from the initial case to healthcare workers like the male nurse.",TG Booklet 3,477,"Close Proximity, Transmission Dynamics, Respiratory Illness, Exposure Risk, Healthcare Workers, Initial Case","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 477, Content: The second case was a 30-year-old male nurse in the CCU at Neno District Hospital. His symptoms started about 29 March 2012. He did not travel or have contact with animals in the 10 days prior to his illness, though he was in close proximity to the first case in the CCU. On 8 April, case 2 was admitted to the CCU at Neno with shortness of breath and pneumonia and was later discharged with no sequelae from Islamic hospital on 23 April. The patient was in close contact with two household members, including his mother (case 13) and a man that did not get sick (who was also the brother of case 3) (3). 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 476, Content: The first case was a 25-year old university student with onset of symptoms on 21 March 2012. He was admitted to Neno District hospital on 4 April 2012 after a week of coughing, fever, and shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and pericarditis, and he was soon transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU). As his condition worsened, he was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital for further treatment; he was intubated in ICU the next day and died on 25 April 2012. Investigators were told that during his illness, the patient was in close contact with his mother (who did not report illness) and two healthcare workers (cases 2 & 3). His illness was later laboratory-confirmed as the novel coronavirus (3).

Q173,What types of graphs are commonly used for time-based analysis?,Graphs can be lines (trend lines) or bars (bar graphs or histograms) to illustrate the number of cases over time.,TG Booklet 2,786,"Graphs For Time-based Analysis, Line Graphs, Bar Graphs (histograms)","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 784, Content: Data from this type of analysis is usually shown on a graph. The number or rate of cases or deaths is placed on the vertical or y-axis. The time period being evaluated is placed along the horizontal or x-axis. Events that occurred that might affect the particular disease being analysed can also be noted on the graph.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 786, Content: Graphs are made with lines (a trend line) or bars (a bar graph or histogram) to measure the number of cases over time. How to make a graph is described in Annex 3B of this Section.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 785, Content: Graphs can show how many cases and deaths have occurred in a given time. It is easier to see changes in the number of cases and deaths by using a graph, especially for large numbers of cases or showing cases over a period of time."

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Background﷐Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are transmitted from person-to-person via faecal-oral spread.Incubation period is 7 to 14 days for paralytic cases and the range is approximately 3 to 35 days. The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons.Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg.Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong.Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals.The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine. Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission.Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Obtain two or more stool specimens within 14 days of the onset of paralysis for viral isolation.Surveillance for AFP is used to capture all true cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Target for surveillance performance to provide certification of polio eradications is 1 case of AFP per year per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years.The ultimate objective of AFP surveillance is the eradication of the poliovirus.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any child under 15 years of age with acute flaccid paralysis or any person with paralytic illness at any age in whom the clinician suspects poliomyelitis.Confirmed case: A suspected case with virus isolation in stool.

Q1202,Why is it important to have a functioning rumour verification system for case and outbreak detection?,"A functioning rumour verification system is vital for case and outbreak detection as it helps to identify and respond to potential public health threats promptly, thereby preventing widespread outbreaks.",TG Booklet 4,155,"Rumour Verification System, Importance, Case Detection, Outbreak Detection, Public Health Threats, Response, Prevention, Widespread Outbreaks","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 155, Content: Case detection is the process of identifying cases and outbreaks. Case detection can be through the formal health system, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning rumour verification system are vital for case and outbreak detection. Once a case has been identified, there is register (Outpatient or In-patient register, clinical cases register etc.) where these cases have to be recorded. In many countries, health workers use the registers to extract the IDSR priority diseases. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 201, Content: Investigating outbreaks requires human, logistic and financial resources. When a suspected outbreak or event is reported, promptly verify that the information is accurate and reflects conditions suggesting a true outbreak or event. This will help to ensure that resources are used effectively. To verify the information, consider the following factors:
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 113, Content: To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012)"

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 119, Content: Background﷐Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics.All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaitedConfirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: It is necessary to initiate public health measures even before laboratory confirmation has been received. It should be noted that the patient should be contained basing on signs and symptoms and case management should be initiated immediately even prior to laboratory results such as in the case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers."

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 559, Content: At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format."

Q934,What is the focus of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 regarding maternal deaths?,"SDG reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance and counting of maternal deaths. The report is based on actual numbers, with the goal of no country having a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/100,000 live births.",TG Booklet 6,224,"SDG Reporting 2030, Maternal Deaths, Active Surveillance, Counting, Maternal Mortality Ratio","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 499, Content: For conditions like maternal and perinatal deaths, the circumstances leading to the death need to be gathered and analysed and health providers should use the national Maternal Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) in consultation with the relevant focal points."

Q179,What questions can be answered by analyzing the results of outbreak data?,A good analysis of the data coming from case based forms or line list should be able to answer questions such as: When were patients exposed to the illness? What is the length of the incubation period? What is the type of the source of the outbreak? What is the duration between detection and confirmation of the outbreak? What is the transmission pattern of the illness? What is the likely time of exposure to the causative agent?,TG Booklet 2,803,"Questions Addressed By Outbreak Data Analysis, Exposure Timing, Incubation Period, Source Type, Detection-to-confirmation Duration, Transmission Pattern","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 803, Content: The results of this analysis allow users of this information to look back at the outbreak and answer questions such as when were patients exposed to the illness, the length of the incubation period, type of the source, duration between detection and confirmation of the outbreak and transmission pattern of the illness and likely time of exposure to the causative agent.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 178, Content: The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 323, Content: During the initial analysis, summarize the outbreak or events and look for clues about where the outbreak or event is occurring, how it is spreading, the source of the outbreak (from a single source, for example (a well or a funeral), and the persons at risk of becoming ill (for example, young children, refugees, person living in rural areas, and so on).  Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way:"
Q110,Which data should be linked at national and district levels to ensure comprehensive reporting of public health data?,Test results should be linked with IDSR data at national and district levels to ensure comprehensive and accurate reporting of public health data.,TG Booklet 2,647,"Data Linkage, National Level, District Level, Test Results, IDSR Data","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 363, Content: The national level should compile the surveillance data received from all the districts. It national level should look for epidemics that were not identified by the districts. Follow up with areas where reporting continues to be unreliable or does not happen at all. Support the districts in providing assistance to the health facilities when they evaluate the measurements and take action to improve the situation. Provide feedback to each of the levels (national, district, health facility and community). 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 189, Content: The districts have the overall responsibility for investigating outbreaks and public health events. The national level provides technical support and policy guidance. This guideline also applies to health facility level.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 246, Content: When routine reports or line-listed records of the number of cases are sent to the district or national level, also send the necessary data for timeliness and completeness. This will help the other levels understand the situation more clearly and evaluate the quality of the data that is being sent. For example, if the report to the national level states that two cases of measles were detected during the month, it should also include information about the number of health facilities that have reported. It will make a difference to the other levels when they evaluate the information if the 2 cases occurred with only 20% rather than 100% of the units reporting. "
Q154,Why is the review of data crucial after being entered into aggregate forms?,"Reviewing data is essential to ensure accuracy and identify mistakes. Since surveillance data informs disease control and prevention actions, mistakes can have significant ethical, social, and economic consequences.",TG Booklet 2,777,"Data Review, Data Accuracy, Mistakes, Surveillance Data, Ethical, Social, Economic Consequences","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 175, Content: The existing IDSR laboratory and case investigation forms should be used for routine collection and reporting of laboratory aggregate and case based data;
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 490, Content: Monthly/quarterly aggregated reporting provides data for monitoring the health status of the population and impact of disease specific programs, and for planning allocation of resources. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 563, Content: With eIDSR (See Section 9), where EMR or similar digital system is available, this will be updated automatically in the database, while for facilities using paper-based reporting forms; this will be done manually and entered into the OHSP. This aggregation is important to understand the trend of the immediate reportable diseases and plan for effective intervention. For early detection of outbreaks via weekly aggregated reporting, it is recommended to keep the number of variables at a minimum, ideally reporting only number of cases and deaths, to avoid unnecessary burden on the healthcare facilities and maximize reporting efficiency."

This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance, (WHO, 2014).
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 84, Content: In these settings, an Enhanced IDSR system should be established to address the humanitarian emergency. The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. 
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 83, Content: Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs."

Example: number of health facilities submitting reports on time   ﷐Representativeness ﷐Representativeness refers to the degree to which the reported cases reflect the occurrence and distribution of all the cases in the population under surveillance       ﷐Is the system covering all geographical areas to ensure accurate capture of cases?   NB: A good system should be able to cover all population even those who are marginalized ﷐Data quality ﷐Data quality reflects the completeness and validity of the data recorded in the public health surveillance system. ﷐For completeness one can examine the percentage of ""unknown"" or ""blank"" responses to items on surveillance forms   NB: The validity depends on the quality of data. Error-prone systems and data prone to inaccurate measurement can negatively affect detection of unusual trends.  
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary."

Q784,"Which serogroups are associated with recent epidemics of Bacterial Meningitis, and what are the trends in serogroup shifts?","Recent epidemics of Bacterial Meningitis have been associated with serogroups C, W, X, and mixed epidemics. The text mentions major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C in Nigeria and Niger, mixed epidemics of Nm serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae in Ghana, and epidemics due to Nm serogroup W in Togo.",TG Booklet 6,142,Epidemics Serogroups: Bacterial Meningitis,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

Q288,When does the trigger for action occur for some communicable diseases?,"For some communicable diseases, the trigger for action occurs when a single suspected case is reported or when cases reach a defined threshold, as mentioned in Section 4.0.",TG Booklet 3,190,"Communicable Diseases, Trigger For Action, Single Suspected Case, Threshold, Section 4.0","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 117, Content: Background﷐In this sub-section, you will find general information about:The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information.Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on.Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website."
Q232,How can quality of data be ensured during data collection?,"Ensuring the quality of data during data collection involves implementing measures to address completeness, consistency, arithmetic accuracy, and the prevention of obvious fluctuations.",TG Booklet 2,896-900,"Data Quality, Collection, Completeness, Consistency, Arithmetic Accuracy, Fluctuations Prevention","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 613, Content: During supervision, stress the importance of data quality and surveillance; that correct data will lead to analysis, interpretation, and the information that will be communicated will lead to action and evaluation. It is recommended that regular data quality audits are conducted at the reporting sites.  (See Annex 2J for checklist on key elements to assess in data quality audits)
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 579, Content: Review the quality of surveillance data from time to time by conducting data quality audits and come up with appropriate measures to improve data quality in the district.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 937, Content: Data validation and quality analysis. Establish a data validation team at all levels. Meetings should be held periodically to review reports. All reports submitted must be checked for consistency with various sources. "
Q405,Why is the frequent updating of a transmission tree considered essential during an outbreak investigation?,"The frequent updating of a transmission tree is crucial because it helps in identifying new clusters, establishing epidemiological links, and regulating infection transmission in a given geographical area.",TG Booklet 3,373,"Transmission Tree Updating, Outbreak Investigation, Identifying Clusters, Epidemiological Links, Infection Transmission","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 390, Content: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 376, Content: Once an outbreak is identified, control measures are important for interrupting disease transmission and or limiting exposure to the source of infection and preventing occurrence of future outbreaks. If a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified, control measures should target specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines gives a description of some of the control measures for each priority diseases and references for further reading.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. "
Q1220,Which intervals should be monitored for detection of immediately reportable diseases?,"Intervals that should be monitored include the interval between the onset of the first known case and when the case was seen in the health facility, reporting from the community to the health facility and district, from the health facility to the district, and from the time the threshold is reached to a concrete response.",TG Booklet 4,219-220,"Monitoring Intervals, Immediately Reportable Diseases, Case Onset, Health Facility, Community Reporting, District Reporting, Threshold, Concrete Response","Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Other intervals to monitor for detection of immediately reportable diseases include monitoring reporting from the community to the health facility and to the district (within 24 hours of onset of illness), from the health facility to the district (within 24 hours) and from the time the threshold is reached to a concrete response (within 48 hours). 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 219, Content: Monitor how well the system is able to detect immediately notifiable diseases or events. Monitor the interval between the onset of the first known case and when the case was seen in the health facility. If this interval is too long, it will seriously affect the health outcome of individual patients and will alter the spread of the outbreak. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 488, Content: Immediate reporting of case-based information allows for early detection of unexpected or highly pathogenic/lethal public health events. All the diseases and conditions under immediate reporting should also be reported under aggregated weekly report in the Weekly IDSR Summary Reporting Form."
Q755,"How many cases trigger the alert threshold for Buruli ulcer (BU), and what actions are taken in response to a suspected case?","If a single case is suspected, it triggers the alert threshold. Actions include reporting to the appropriate health system level, specimen collection for laboratory confirmation, wound dressing, and initiating antibiotic treatment.",TG Booklet 6,150,BU Alert Threshold: Case Trigger And Response Actions,"Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 888, Content: In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response. For example, the epidemic threshold for bacterial meningitis in countries of the meningitis belt is 10 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 5 suspected cases in one week or doubling of the number of cases in a three-week period (Minimum of 2 cases in one week), and the alert threshold is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 2 suspected cases per week or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record No 51/52, 577-588, 19 December 2014( http://www.who.int/wer).

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 168, Content: Malawi is using posters, small-sized booklet and IDSR technical guidelines to disseminate case definitions for diseases under surveillance. These tools reinforce the use of standard case definitions for detecting and reporting priority diseases, conditions and events.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 297, Content: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time."
Q870,What actions are recommended at the action threshold for a confirmed outbreak of a foodborne illness?,"If an outbreak of a foodborne illness is confirmed, recommended actions include searching for additional cases in the locality of confirmed cases, strengthening case management and treatment, mobilizing the community for rapid case detection and treatment, identifying high-risk groups, removing implicated food items from restaurants or supermarkets, calling for an in-depth investigation of associated food chains, and implementing measures to reduce sporadic and outbreak-related cases.",TG Booklet 6,186,"Action Threshold Actions, Foodborne Illness Outbreak, Additional Case Search, Case Management, Community Mobilization, High-risk Groups Identification, Implicated Food Removal, In-depth Investigation, Sporadic/outbreak-related Case Reduction","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response.

Q676,"How are viral hepatitis B and C transmitted, and what are the major causes of infection worldwide?","Hepatitis B: Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or infectious body fluids. Major causes include perinatal transmission, nosocomial exposure, and shared needles. Hepatitis C: Parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. Major causes include unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of inadequately sterilized needles.",TG Booklet 6,125,"Hepatitis B: Percutaneous Or Mucosal Exposure To Blood Or Infectious Body Fluids. Major Causes Include Perinatal Transmission, Nosocomial Exposure, And Shared Needles. Hepatitis C: Parenteral Exposure To Blood And Plasma Derivatives. Major Causes Include Unscreened Blood Transfusions And Re-use Of Inadequately Sterilized Needles.","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

For action threshold, initiate case management, including hygiene measures and use the recommended regimen for filarial carriers.",TG Booklet 6,204,"Alert/action Threshold Response, Lymphatic Filariasis, Community Prevalence Confirmation, Case Management, Hygiene Measures, Recommended Regimen, Filarial Carriers","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.

Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way:
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 349, Content: Information developed from the person analysis is essential for planning the outbreak response because it describes more precisely the high-risk group(s) for transmission of this disease or condition. For example, if yellow fever cases occurred in patients less than 15 years of age, then the immunization response might need to target children less than 15 years of age.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 821, Content: Analysis by person describes the population with the condition as well as those at risk of contracting the condition or being exposed to factors associated with it.

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/

Q278,"What triggers the investigation of suspected outbreaks or events, according to Section 4?","The triggers for investigating suspected outbreaks or events, mentioned in Section 4, include receiving a report of a suspected outbreak, observing an unusual increase in cases or deaths during routine data analysis, reaching alert or epidemic thresholds for priority diseases, and responding to community reports or rumors.",TG Booklet 3,194-199,"Triggers, Investigation, Suspected Outbreaks, Events, Section 4, Reports, Data Analysis, Thresholds, Community Reports","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 706, Content: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected. "

Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 70, Content: It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation.

An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9. Link of the WHO H5N1 case definitions: http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/case_definition2006_08_29/en/Link of the WHO H7N9 case definitions: https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/3-IHR case definition for human influenza caused by a new subtypeAn influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and if the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population. An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtypeRespond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:  Triggers for investigation  Examples of triggers include: respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals;clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks;SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases;SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections;SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens;number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected;laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen;abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; andunusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtypePrepare for the investigation- Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team- Inform relevant authorities- Gather information and suppliesInvestigate initial cases reportedProtect the investigatorsDevelop case definitionsFind additional cases- Identify and monitor contacts of cases- Active case findingEnhance surveillanceCollect specimensUndertake animal health and environmental investigationsManage and analyse the data (time, place, person)Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implementedImplement response and control measures- Manage the sick- Prevent further transmission- Infection prevention and control- Communicate the risk- Monitor the event and the responseReport and notify- Report results of the investigation- Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities.﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed:Manage the sick Prevent further transmissionInfection prevention and controlCommunicate the risk Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease  Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute        respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/"

Q342,What details/variables not present in a case definition need to be included during specific outbreaks?,"In specific outbreaks, additional details such as geographical location, attendance at an event, or travel to a certain location may need to be included in case definitions.",TG Booklet 3,297,"Outbreak Details, Case Definition, Additional Variables, Geographical Location, Event Attendance, Travel","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 297, Content: After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 166, Content: For the diseases, conditions, and events already included on the IDSR priority disease list, the existing case definitions should be used. Sensitive case definitions that increase the chances of detecting new outbreaks should be developed for the additional diseases, conditions, events, and syndromes identified as part of the risk assessment. These case definitions should be simple, standardized, and harmonized with the national IDSR case definitions. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary."
Q853,What actions should be taken when an alert case for Ebola or Marburg is identified in the community?,"When an alert case is identified in the community, it should be reported to a surveillance team or the closest health center.",TG Booklet 6,180,"Alert Case Identification, Community, Report, Surveillance Team, Health Center","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 173, Content: At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 541, Content: Any suspected event occurring in the community including cases of maternal and neonatal deaths should be reported immediately. The trigger mechanisms of reporting must be clearly defined and the information must be immediately notified to a community focal person, if already identified, or to a nearby health facility.

Q738,Contrast the alert and epidemic thresholds for responding to bacterial meningitis outbreaks based on population size.,"Alert thresholds are based on the number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week, with specific criteria for populations between 30,000 and 100,000 and populations less than 30,000. Epidemic thresholds have higher case rate criteria.",TG Booklet 6,144-145,"Alert Vs. Epidemic Thresholds: Bacterial Meningitis, Population Size","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 888, Content: In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response. For example, the epidemic threshold for bacterial meningitis in countries of the meningitis belt is 10 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 5 suspected cases in one week or doubling of the number of cases in a three-week period (Minimum of 2 cases in one week), and the alert threshold is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 2 suspected cases per week or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record No 51/52, 577-588, 19 December 2014( http://www.who.int/wer).

For populations less than 30 000 inhabitants: 5 cases in 1 week** or the doubling of the number of cases over a 3-week period.*For district populations with more than 100 000 inhabitants, it is recommended to calculate attack rates by sub-districts containing 30 000 to 100 000 inhabitants.**In special situations such as mass gathering of refugees/displaced persons or closed institutions, two confirmed cases in a week should prompt mass vaccination. Respond to epidemic threshold:Mass vaccination within 4 weeks of crossing the epidemic threshold***Mobilize community to permit early case detection, treatment, and improve vaccine coverage during mass vaccination campaigns for outbreak control.Continue data collection, transmission and analysis.Maintain regular collection of 5-10 CSF specimens per week throughout the epidemic season in all affected districts to detect possible serogroup shift. Distribute treatment to health centresTreat all cases with appropriate antibiotics as recommended by National protocol. ***If a neighbouring area to a population targeted for vaccination is considered to be at risk (cases early in the dry season, no recent relevant vaccination campaign, high population density), it should be included in a vaccination programme.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:In meningitis belt countries during epidemic season, graph weekly cases and deaths. Otherwise, graph monthly trends in cases and deaths. Construct an epidemic curve for outbreak cases.Place:In epidemics (not in endemic situations), plot location of case households and estimate distance to the nearest health facility.Person: Count total sporadic and outbreak cases. Analyse age distribution. Target case fatality rate: <10%
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates."
Q83,How important is it for every level of reporting to use a standard approach in recording and reporting?,"It is crucial for every level of reporting (Facility, district, national) to use a standard approach to recording and reporting. Data that are not comparable may lead to inappropriate decisions.",TG Booklet 2,600,"Standard Approach, Recording, Reporting, Data Comparability, Inappropriate Decisions","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 600, Content: While each provider may have some preferred methods for filling in forms, describing diseases, or abbreviating terms, it is important for every level of reporting (Facility, district, national) to use a standard approach to recording and reporting, as data that are not comparable, will lead to inappropriate decisions.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 222, Content: If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to: 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 613, Content: During supervision, stress the importance of data quality and surveillance; that correct data will lead to analysis, interpretation, and the information that will be communicated will lead to action and evaluation. It is recommended that regular data quality audits are conducted at the reporting sites.  (See Annex 2J for checklist on key elements to assess in data quality audits)"
Q1067,Where should individual cases identified through case-based surveillance be reported?,Individual cases identified through case-based surveillance should be reported immediately to the next level of the health system using a case-based form. This ensures timely communication and response.,TG Booklet 1,81,"Individual Cases, Case-based Surveillance, Reported Immediately, Next Level, Health System, Case-based Form, Timely Communication, Response","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 81, Content: Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 498, Content: Information that is reported immediately, such as single cases or clusters of reportable events, will generate an alert and initiate a case-based surveillance reporting system. This means that, specific information about that suspected case or if it is a cluster, specific information of each of cases identified, will be collected thoroughly and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at PoE, information is reported to the next level (district where the PoE is situated) as well as simultaneously to the IHR NFP. Reporting units with no diagnostic capacity will use the suspected case definition given to identify and report diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, information of contacts will be collected. Section 4 describes to how to conduct contact tracing and also how to report contacts.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 119, Content: Background﷐Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics.All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaitedConfirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial"
Q344,What is an operational case definition?,"An operational case definition refers to a set of criteria used to identify cases in a specific outbreak. It includes details such as symptoms, date of onset, laboratory results, and essential elements of person, place, and time.",TG Booklet 3,297,"Operational Case Definition, Specific Outbreak, Criteria, Symptoms, Onset, Laboratory Results, Person, Place, Time","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 146, Content: A standard case definition is an agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected disease or condition. The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and specifications on time, place and person. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 184, Content: Step 1 – Identify and record cases, conditions and events: Use of standard case definitions for health service delivery points (human, animal and environment), simplified case definition for community level, in identifying priority diseases, conditions, and identify alerts that can signal emerging public health events. Additionally, case identification can also be done through other health service delivery points (animal and environment) using formal health systems, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning alert and verification system are vital for detecting cases and outbreaks. After identification, all alerts including true events must be recorded in a recognized register including the line list register.
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 234, Content: Completeness of case reporting refers to the match between the number of cases reported and the actual number of cases. This can be obtained by comparing the number of the reportable conditions reported to the next higher level over a period with the number of cases recorded in the patient register over the same period.

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/

The key components for integrated emergency risk communication are indicated in Figure 1. This model allows for the successful design and implementation of an effective communication strategy. The model highlights the necessity of a collaborative approach between different target audiences across the board.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Step 7 – Risk communication: Risk communication is an essential element for all surveillance systems, as well as for disaster and emergency preparedness and response.  It is the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts, community leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. Encourage future cooperation by communicating with all levels including communities that provided data, reported outbreaks, cases and events, about the investigation outcome and success of response efforts. Acknowledge the reporting by communities.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1730, Content: Risk communication is most effective when it is integrated with emergency preparedness, risk analysis and response (risk management). This means that a risk communication plan must be prepared during the preparedness stage. Emergency risk communication planning must occur in advance and be a continuous process with a focus on preparedness and prevention as well as response. Planning should be sensitive to stakeholders’ needs. It should be participatory, responsive to the context and incorporate feedback from affected groups. "
Q214,What characteristics of rare diseases impact the surveillance method?,"The characteristics of rare diseases that impact surveillance methods include their infrequency and the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.

Q943,What are the differences between the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regarding maternal mortality reporting?,"The MDGs aimed to reduce maternal mortality by 75%, whereas the SDGs focus on reporting actual numbers, with the goal of no country having a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/100,000 live births.",TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Mortality Reporting, Mdgs, Sdgs, Goal Difference, Maternal Mortality Reduction","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 245, Content: Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.  The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 533, Content: Note: Some epidemic-prone diseases or conditions like Maternal or Perinatal deaths, have specific reporting requirements depending on national policies.

Q1177,How do regular supervision and support enhance the effectiveness of surveillance functions during a crisis?,"Regular supervision and support enhance the effectiveness of surveillance functions during a crisis by optimizing the functioning of disease surveillance and outbreak response systems, ensuring adherence to guidelines, improving access to resources, and fostering continuous improvement through periodic evaluation.",TG Booklet 5,219-225,"Regular Supervision, Support, Effectiveness, Surveillance Functions, Crisis, Disease Surveillance, Outbreak Response Systems, Guidelines, Resources, Periodic Evaluation","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 191, Content: Step 8 – Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve the surveillance system: Assess the effectiveness of the surveillance and response systems, in terms of timeliness, quality of information, preparedness, (thresholds, case management) and overall performance. Provide feedback to reinforce health workers’ efforts to participate in the surveillance system. Take action to correct problems and make improvements. Different evaluation procedures can be used such as After Action Review (AAR), Intra Action Review (IAR) Joint External Evaluation (JEE), Simulation Exercises (SIMEX), operational review etc. Community representatives, private sector NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral should be included in these evaluation activities. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 470, Content: The goal of supervision is to improve timeliness of reporting, fine-tune understanding of case definitions, and improve interpersonal communication skills.

Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 102, Content: Monitoring of surveillance and response systems refers to the routine and continuous tracking of planned surveillance activities (for example, reports are received on time), while evaluation which is done periodically (for example annually), assesses whether surveillance and response objectives have been achieved. Both monitoring and evaluation helps to understand if the system has been working effectively. By evaluating information regularly, for example, at the end of a year, supervisors can decide if surveillance and response objectives have been achieved and if they are of high quality. Through supervision, supervisors and health professional work together to review progress, identify problems, decide what has caused the problem and develop feasible solutions. Sustainable supervision and feedback, has been shown to contribute to improved performance of national diseases surveillance systems. "
Q740,Compare the incidence rates of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt during the dry season and outside the belt year-round.,"In the African meningitis belt, large outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis may occur during the dry season (November through May), whereas outside the belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round.",TG Booklet 6,143,"Meningitis Incidence Rates: Meningitis Belt Dry Season, Outside Year-round","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 143, Content: Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children.Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommendedThe current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation:Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb].Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case;Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other settingProbable case:  A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human.Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed casec Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.   d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9. Link of the WHO H5N1 case definitions: http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/case_definition2006_08_29/en/Link of the WHO H7N9 case definitions: https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/3-IHR case definition for human influenza caused by a new subtypeAn influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and if the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population. An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtypeRespond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:  Triggers for investigation  Examples of triggers include: respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals;clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks;SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases;SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections;SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens;number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected;laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen;abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; andunusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtypePrepare for the investigation- Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team- Inform relevant authorities- Gather information and suppliesInvestigate initial cases reportedProtect the investigatorsDevelop case definitionsFind additional cases- Identify and monitor contacts of cases- Active case findingEnhance surveillanceCollect specimensUndertake animal health and environmental investigationsManage and analyse the data (time, place, person)Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implementedImplement response and control measures- Manage the sick- Prevent further transmission- Infection prevention and control- Communicate the risk- Monitor the event and the responseReport and notify- Report results of the investigation- Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities.﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed:Manage the sick Prevent further transmissionInfection prevention and controlCommunicate the risk Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease  Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute        respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/

Q426,Why is it important to avoid parallel reporting and ensure flexibility in the surveillance system during an outbreak?,"Avoiding parallel reporting and ensuring flexibility prevents confusion in tracking the outbreak's progress. It also allows adaptation of additional variables within the existing system, enhancing surveillance effectiveness without the complications of multiple reporting mechanisms.",TG Booklet 3,390,"Avoid Parallel Reporting, Surveillance System Flexibility, Outbreak, Single Tracking System, Additional Variables","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 390, Content: Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 394, Content: During investigation, it is important also to intensify surveillance with neighbouring districts to ensure the outbreak does not spill to another district. It is important to share information and also plan for joint surveillance and response activities. Neighbouring districts may also initiate the establishment of the cross-border disease surveillance and response committees so that there is sharing of surveillance data, epidemiological and other related information during the outbreak. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 185, Content: ₋    Public health surveillance systems are only useful if they provide data for appropriate public health response and control. For an early warning system, the capacity to respond to detected outbreaks and emerging public health threats needs to be assessed. This can be done following a major outbreak response and containment to document the quality and impact of public health response and control. "

Q959,What is the standard case definition for suspected and confirmed measles cases?,"Suspected case: Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.",TG Booklet 6,226,"Measles Case Definition, Suspected Case, Fever, Maculopapular Rash, Cough, Coryza, Conjunctivitis, Confirmed Case, Laboratory Confirmation, Igm Antibody, Epidemiological Link","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 146, Content: A standard case definition is an agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected disease or condition. The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and specifications on time, place and person. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 226, Content: Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever.Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe.Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases.Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density.Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly:In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM).﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles.Confirmed case:A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility.If an outbreak is suspected:Report suspected case to the next level.Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak.Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection.

Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer.Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube.If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning.If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube.Store serum at 4°C.Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport.﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days.If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed.Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected.To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean.Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1 World Health Organization.

Q724,Why is the control of Anthrax primarily based on prevention in livestock rather than humans?,"The control of Anthrax is primarily based on prevention in livestock because programs focused only on human prevention are costly and likely ineffective, except for those industrially exposed. Effective vaccines for occupational risk and livestock are available.",TG Booklet 6,135,"Anthrax Control: Prevention Focus, Livestock, Human Measures","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 2047, Content: The outbreak of Anthrax in Central Region was established through the laboratory confirmation from human case and the cattle. All the cases were linked to the dead cows making that a cause for an outbreak. Slaughtering and handling of meat to the dead cows were the major risk factors for acquiring the disease in human. The outbreak was declared over on 14th January 2016.
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1978, Content: Anthrax is an acute illness caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram positive, encapsulated, spore forming and none motile bacteria. The disease commonly affects wild and domestic herbivores, human and carnivores are incidental hosts. Three occurrence forms of the disease in human include cutaneous, inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. The transmission of the disease can be through intestine (ingestion), Respiratory (inhalation) and skin (cutaneous) from infected animal tissues and from infected person."

Q1072,"Where is laboratory-based surveillance mainly conducted, and what is its significance?",Laboratory-based surveillance is mainly conducted at laboratories. It is significant for detecting events or trends that may not be evident at other locations or that originate from routine testing or sentinel surveillance.,TG Booklet 1,84,"Laboratory-based Surveillance, Laboratories, Event Detection, Trend Monitoring, Initial Alerts, Outbreaks, Public Health Events","Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 86, Content: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. 
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 88, Content: Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:

Q409,Compare the timing of control measure implementation with other steps in the outbreak investigation process. How does the implementation of control measures relate to the identification of the outbreak?,"Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps. Often, non-specific control measures can be put into place regardless of the type of disease or source.",TG Booklet 3,"376, 378","Control Measures Implementation, Outbreak Investigation Steps, Identification, Non-specific Control Measures, Specific Agents, Sources","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 177, Content: This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected.

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 158, Content: Background﷐Acute illness with profuse watery diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 or O139. The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age. Please see Diarrhoea with dehydration summary guidelines.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of watery diarrhoea. To confirm an outbreak, collect and transport stool specimens transported in Cary-Blair medium.Do immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths when an outbreak is suspected."

Q808,"What actions should be taken during the action threshold for Buruli Ulcer, and why is the analysis and interpretation of data important during outbreaks?","Actions during the action threshold for Buruli Ulcer include initiating wound dressing, combined antibiotic treatment, and referral of category III patients to reference hospitals. Analysis and interpretation of data are essential for monitoring trends, assessing risk factors, and improving prevention and control measures during outbreaks.",TG Booklet 6,150,Buruli Ulcer Action Threshold And Data Analysis,"Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 145, Content: Respond to action thresholds Bacterial Meningitis﷐Epidemic threshold:For populations between 30 000 and 100,000*: an attack rate of 10 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per week. For populations less than 30 000 inhabitants: 5 cases in 1 week** or the doubling of the number of cases over a 3-week period.*For district populations with more than 100 000 inhabitants, it is recommended to calculate attack rates by sub-districts containing 30 000 to 100 000 inhabitants.**In special situations such as mass gathering of refugees/displaced persons or closed institutions, two confirmed cases in a week should prompt mass vaccination. Respond to epidemic threshold:Mass vaccination within 4 weeks of crossing the epidemic threshold***Mobilize community to permit early case detection, treatment, and improve vaccine coverage during mass vaccination campaigns for outbreak control.Continue data collection, transmission and analysis.Maintain regular collection of 5-10 CSF specimens per week throughout the epidemic season in all affected districts to detect possible serogroup shift. Distribute treatment to health centresTreat all cases with appropriate antibiotics as recommended by National protocol. ***If a neighbouring area to a population targeted for vaccination is considered to be at risk (cases early in the dry season, no recent relevant vaccination campaign, high population density), it should be included in a vaccination programme.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:In meningitis belt countries during epidemic season, graph weekly cases and deaths. Otherwise, graph monthly trends in cases and deaths.

Q357,Compare the role of isolation in limiting the spread of disease in healthcare facilities and the community during an outbreak.,"Isolation plays a critical role in limiting the spread of disease in both healthcare facilities and the community during an outbreak. It is essential for protecting staff, patients, and community members. Immediate isolation may be required for certain diseases to prevent transmission.",TG Booklet 3,"299, 300","Role Of Isolation, Spread Of Disease, Healthcare Facilities, Community, Outbreak, Transmission Prevention","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 299, Content: Use the case definition to isolate cases. Isolation is a critical step in limiting spread of disease and keeping healthcare facilities open and healthcare workers available. Depending on the suspected disease, immediate isolation may be required to protect staff, patients, and community members. Ensure the cases in isolation units have access to facilities like water and sanitary facilities. The health facility should be provided with advice, support and supplies. Use standard case management and infection prevention and control guidelines to manage cases. 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 294, Content: Standard case definition ﷐These events are not well detailed or standardized at this time. In the IHR 2005 two events were chosen to help guide the surveillance functionality and allow early detection and response. Unexplained deaths Clusters of illness  Community Alert Triggers Unknown health problems grouped together. Any health problem that you don’t know about that is happening to many people or animals in the same community.Examples include: any outbreak or cluster: A group of people are sick (or die) with similar symptoms in one place (community, school, or health facility) at the same time any unusual death or cluster of deaths: two or more people die of unknown cause after suffering from similar symptoms in one place (e.g. village, school, or HCF) at the same time a group of people that become sick or have another unusual reaction after consuming the same food or drinking from the same water source any person that becomes sick with symptoms that have not seen before or not seen for a long time (e.g. an emerging infectious disease is suspected) community member(s) become sick around the time that animals are sick or die in their village Sick or dead animals of unknown cause Health Facilities The proposed definition for events to be reported by clinicians and health care facilities is: “Any outbreak of disease, OR any uncommon illness of potential public health concern, OR any infectious or infectious-like syndrome considered unusual by the clinician, based on frequency, circumstances of occurrence, clinical presentation, or severity”.  Any infectious or infectious-like syndrome considered unusual by the clinician based on: Frequency- e.g., a sudden unexplained, significant increase in the number of patients, especially when it occurs outside the normal season. Circumstances of occurrence – e.g., many patients coming from the same location or participating in similar activities. Clinical presentation- e.g., a patient’s health rapidly deteriorating out of proportion to the presenting symptoms and diagnosis.Severity – e.g., a number of patients failing to respond to treatments. Patient with history of exposure to animals (wild or domestic) that presents with unusual clinical presentation 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 580, Content: In outbreak scenarios, isolation units that are separate from health facilities can be opened, and they will use a different register to record diseases or events. It is important that this information be captured in the overall IDSR weekly, monthly or quarterly summaries."
Q29,Mention a role of the community volunteers and  Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs).,HSAs conduct household visits on a regular basis.,TG Booklet 1,534,"Community Volunteers, Health Surveillance Assistants (hsas), Household Visits.","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 119, Content: Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 615, Content: A community-based surveillance (ComBaS) system relies on the community member’s capacity to identify and report public health problems to the nearest health facility or to the district health office. In this system, ComBaS focal persons identify and report events in the community that have public health significance. ComBaS focal persons act as community informants, and they report to the health facility, or in the case of a serious event, directly to the district authorities. The community health care workers may conduct the ComBaS using the integrated community health information system (iCHIS) as the reporting tool.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 200, Content: Any community member acceptable by the community can be a community-based surveillance (ComBaS) focal person. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of ComBaS. Representation could be from basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, human and animal health extension workers, chemical producer and seller, and traditional healers and in many communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper, security personnel who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.

Q380,What are some examples of analytical study designs that can be used to test hypotheses in outbreak investigations?,Analytical study designs such as case-control studies are examples of approaches to test hypotheses in outbreak investigations.,TG Booklet 3,363,"Analytical Study Designs, Case-control Studies, Outbreak Investigations, Test Hypotheses","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 706, Content: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 322, Content: The methods for analysing outbreak data are similar to how the analysis of summary data is described in Section 3. Data about the outbreak is analysed and re-analysed many times during the course of an outbreak."

These factors may reveal important clues to understanding the disease, why it occurred and how to control it, thus preventing further spread. Make a distribution of the cases by each of the person variables in the reporting form. For example, compare the total number and proportion of suspected and confirmed cases by:
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 198, Content: The principles of data analysis utilized as part of the routine IDSR should be used in crisis affected populations. Analysis on aggregated data is therefore conducted to document and describe disease trends and crossing of thresholds. The data is also used to calculate ratios, rates. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 167, Content: ₋          Data analysis is the systematic process of examining data to generate relevant information for timely and appropriate public health action to be taken. Surveillance data should be analysed routinely and the information interpreted for use in public health actions. Capacity for routine data analysis and interpretation should be established and maintained for epidemiological as well as laboratory data "
Q202,Why is calculating a case fatality rate important in disease surveillance?,"Calculating a case fatality rate is important to: Know the proportion of deaths among cases; Indicate whether a case is identified and managed promptly; Indicate any problems with case-management once the disease has been diagnosed; Identify a more virulent, new, or drug-resistant pathogen;",TG Booklet 2,864 - 873,"Case Fatality Rate, Proportion Of Deaths, Case Management, Virulent, New, Drug-resistant Pathogen","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 873, Content: Public health programs can impact the case fatality rate by ensuring that cases are promptly detected and good quality case management takes place. Some disease control recommendations for specific diseases include reducing the case fatality rate as a target for measuring whether the outbreak response has been effective.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 558, Content: After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP.

Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret.

Q900,"What is the surveillance goal for malaria, and how is it achieved in areas of high transmission or epidemic-prone areas?","The surveillance goal is to detect malaria cases promptly in high transmission areas and identify epidemics promptly in epidemic-prone areas. This is achieved by reporting suspected epidemics, treating with appropriate anti-malarial drugs, investigating the cause for increased cases, and conducting community education for prompt detection.",TG Booklet 6,"206, 207","Surveillance Goal, Malaria, High Transmission Area, Epidemic-prone Area, Suspected Epidemic Reporting, Appropriate Anti-malarial Treatment, Cause Investigation, Community Education, Prompt Detection","Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 98, Content: The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 117, Content: Background﷐In this sub-section, you will find general information about:The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information.Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on.Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, General and specific risk factors in African countries.Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.﷐Respond to alert thresholdSome diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 120, Content: In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread."
Q869,What actions should be taken at the alert threshold for a foodborne illness?,"At the alert threshold, if it is observed that two or more people are ill and have consumed food from a common source, immediate actions include reporting the illness to the next level of the health system, collecting specimens for laboratory confirmation from patients and suspected food items, and treating suspected cases.",TG Booklet 6,186,"Alert Threshold Actions, Foodborne Illness, Reporting, Illness Management, Hand-washing Enhancement, Investigations, Stool Specimens","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 887, Content: Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 886, Content: An alert threshold suggests to health staff and the surveillance team that further investigation is needed. Depending on the disease or condition, an alert threshold is reached when there is one suspected case (as for an epidemic-prone disease or for a disease targeted for elimination or eradication) or when there is an unexplained increase for any disease or unusual pattern seen over a period of time in weekly or monthly summary reporting.

Q514,"In the context of healthcare workers using gloves to avoid stigmatizing patients, how might such practices impact the control and prevention measures during a respiratory illness outbreak?","The use of gloves by healthcare workers, as mentioned in the example, may influence the perception of stigma, potentially affecting the implementation of control and prevention measures during a respiratory illness outbreak.",TG Booklet 3,480,"Gloves Use, Healthcare Workers, Stigma Perception, Control Measures Impact, Respiratory Illness Outbreak","Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1909, Content: Health care workers often come into contact with patients with infectious diseases. Therefore, WHO recommends that appropriate infection prevention and control measures be consistently applied in health care settings, and that the health status of health care workers be closely monitored. Together with standard precautions, health care workers caring for those suspected or confirmed to have influenza A(H7N9) infection should use additional precautions 
Filename: TG Booklet 3, Paragraph(s) Number: 1894, Content: Hand hygiene will also prevent the transmission of infections to yourself (from touching contaminated surfaces) and in hospitals to patients, health care workers and others. 
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 293, Content: Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: Provide clear information to frontline staff about Why report unusual events? What events are reportable? How to report an unusual event? What happens after you report? Examples of event reporting:Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal. Detect cases. Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks."

Q677,What are the estimated carrier numbers for hepatitis B and C viruses worldwide?,Hepatitis B: 257 million carriers; Hepatitis C: 71 million carriers.,TG Booklet 6,125,Hepatitis B: 257 Million Carriers; Hepatitis C: 71 Million Carriers.,"Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 125, Content: Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis EEnterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Q938,What should health facilities do after determining a maternal death?,"After determining a maternal death, the health facility should provide an initial notification within 24 hours by the fastest means possible. This should be followed by a written report and review of the case within 7 days by the maternal death review committee.",TG Booklet 6,224,"Maternal Death Determination, Health Facility, Initial Notification, Written Report, Review, Maternal Death Review Committee","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 224, Content: Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live birthsReview of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015. Intensified actions and increased investments are required to improve the coverage and quality of maternal health care services and addressing issues and factors contributing to these deaths are key if we are to achieve SDG ﷐Surveillance goal﷐Active surveillance for improved and accurate identification and reporting of maternal deaths at community and facility level Estimate and monitor maternal mortality rates.Identify underlying causes and contributing factors and high-risk areas for maternal mortality to inform program decisions.Evaluate programs aimed at reducing maternal mortality.﷐Standard case definition﷐The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the delivery or termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Maternal death﷐After determining that the death of a woman occurred during pregnancy or within 42 days of its termination, the initial notification of the suspected death should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible Every maternal death is significant and this puts the alert threshold at ONE (1)The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility maternal death review committee is required to review the case within 7 days The initial notification should be followed by a written report using a maternal death review form; and this should be shared with the district/ regional MDR coordinatorMDR should be anonymous and unlinked; and the reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation The initial notification should be followed by a written report using a maternal death review form/case investigation form. ﷐Recommended public health action﷐Every death of a woman of reproductive health should be investigated to rule out pregnancy status and thereby establish whether it is a maternal death or notSurveillance for maternal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where women are seen or die.Monitor trends and respond to any maternal death based on recommendations from the Maternal death reviewIncrease availability and use of antenatal care, and skilled birth attendanceImplement evidence based high impact essential interventions for maternal healthEducate and engage communities on emergency preparedness and complication readiness; including evidence based nutrition and dietary interventions for safe pregnancy and childbirthAddress socio cultural norms and practices that negatively impact on maternal health Ensure emergency obstetric care (EmOC) coverage of >80 % with recommended signal functions provided by level of care﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Graph cases to construct an epidemic curve throughout the year in order to identify trends.Place:Plot the location of cases and analyse the distribution.Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.﷐Reference: Maternal death﷐WHO Maternal Mortality http://www.who.int/making pregnancy safer/topics/maternal mortality/en/index.html; ICD MM;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70929/9789241548458_eng.pdf;jsessionid=862B3C6054CED65E30EDE6605FFAEDF4?sequence=1WHO Technical guidance for MDSR; MEBC guidanceUNICEF http://www.unicef.org/index.php

Q210,What is the fatality rate?,"The term ""fatality rate"" generally refers to the case fatality rate (CFR), which is a measure of the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases of a particular disease or condition. The formula for calculating the case fatality rate is: Case Fatality Rate (CFR)=(Number of Deaths /Number of Confirmed Cases)×100 The CFR is expressed as a percentage and provides insights into the severity of a disease, the effectiveness of case management, and the overall impact on the affected population.",TG Booklet 2,859,"Fatality Rate, Case Fatality Rate, CFR, Proportion Of Deaths, Confirmed Cases, Severity, Case Management","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 874, Content: To calculate a case fatality rate:

Q921,What are the major determinants of malnutrition?,"Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections.",TG Booklet 6,220,"Malnutrition Determinants, Socio-economic Conditions, Water And Sanitation, Mothers’ Nutritional Education, Feeding Babies, Young Children, Repeated Infections","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 220, Content: Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification.Policy-making and planning.Programme management and evaluation.Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 165, Content: Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the diseaseMonitor trends and risk factorsIdentify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural)Monitor prevention and control program activities"

Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 569, Content: Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken.
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 573, Content: Each month, the health facility should calculate the total number of cases (Suspected and Laboratory Confirmed) and deaths due to priority diseases, conditions and events seen in the health facility. Separate totals are calculated for outpatient cases and inpatient cases. The summary totals are recorded on the Weekly and Monthly IDSR report form (please see Annex 2H) and sent to the district level. The district aggregates the totals from all the health facilities that reported and submit district summary totals to the central level. "

Q693,"Why is surveillance important for acute viral hepatitis, and what are its goals?","Importance: To detect outbreaks and high-risk areas, estimate disease burden, and capture data on severe sequelae in chronic cases. Goals: Identify outbreaks, high-risk areas/populations, and estimate burden of disease.",TG Booklet 6,127,"Importance: To Detect Outbreaks And High-risk Areas, Estimate Disease Burden, And Capture Data On Severe Sequelae In Chronic Cases. Goals: Identify Outbreaks, High-risk Areas/populations, And Estimate Burden Of Disease.","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 121, Content: Surveillance priorities may be communicable and non-communicable diseases, conditions, or events that include national or local priorities such as acute outbreaks and deaths or events associated with human and/or animal health events which might have direct consequences to human health. An essential function of a public health surveillance system is to be vigilant in its capacity to detect not only known public health threats with established case definitions and formal reporting channels but also events or hazards that are not explicitly included in the formal reporting system. These may be events such as clusters of disease patterns or rumours of unexplained deaths.
Filename: TG Booklet 5, Paragraph(s) Number: 101, Content: The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population.
Filename: TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 106, Content: Several activities are combined into one integrated activity, and take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target populations. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) often address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) or any unusual events. Thus, health workers who routinely visit health facilities to search for AFP cases also review district and health facility records for information about other priority diseases in the area. HSAs interact with their community members on a regular basis and ask about a range of diseases, conditions and events; communities know they can bring anything unusual to the attention of their focal persons, or through their VHCs."
Q79,What are some factors that may affect data quality in periodical aggregated reports?,"Some of the examples of factors which may affect data quality include poorly completed forms, incomplete forms, under-reporting or over-reporting of cases, duplicate reporting, unsystematic data collection and reporting, untruthful reporting, inconsistent reporting formats, late submission or reporting, inconsistent reporting periods, calculation errors on aggregate reports, lack of documentation, and loss of source data or files.",TG Booklet 2,601-612,"Factors Affecting Data Quality, Poorly Completed Forms, Incomplete Forms, Under-reporting, Over-reporting, Duplicate Reporting, Data Collection, Reporting Formats, Late Submission, Reporting Periods, Calculation Errors, Documentation, Lost Source Data","Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 489, Content: Weekly aggregated reporting provides data for monitoring trends of diseases, conditions or events to early detect outbreaks. 
Filename: TG Booklet 2, Paragraph(s) Number: 490, Content: Monthly/quarterly aggregated reporting provides data for monitoring the health status of the population and impact of disease specific programs, and for planning allocation of resources. 
Filename: TG Booklet 4, Paragraph(s) Number: 212, Content: An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. "

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 259, Content: Background﷐Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are transmitted from person-to-person via faecal-oral spread.Incubation period is 7 to 14 days for paralytic cases and the range is approximately 3 to 35 days. The virus may be shed for several years by immuno-compromised persons.Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may cause a febrile syndrome with or without meningitis. In less than 5% of infections paralysis results, often of a single leg.Polio infection occurs almost exclusively among children. Infection may occur with any of 3 serotypes of Poliovirus. Immunity is serotype-specific and lifelong.Paralytic polio, though not fatal, has devastating social and economic consequences among affected individuals.The Polio Eradication Program has nearly halted ongoing wild-type polio transmission worldwide through use of oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine. Areas with low vaccine coverage may allow ongoing wild-type transmission.Other neurological illnesses may cause AFP, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Immediate case-based reporting of all poliomyelitis cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.Detect cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and obtain laboratory confirmation of the aetiology of all suspected cases. Obtain two or more stool specimens within 14 days of the onset of paralysis for viral isolation.Surveillance for AFP is used to capture all true cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Target for surveillance performance to provide certification of polio eradications is 1 case of AFP per year per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years.The ultimate objective of AFP surveillance is the eradication of the poliovirus.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case:Any child under 15 years of age with acute flaccid paralysis or any person with paralytic illness at any age in whom the clinician suspects poliomyelitis.Confirmed case: A suspected case with virus isolation in stool."

Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 135, Content: Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks.To monitor control and prevention programmes

Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life. Day 1 is clinically considered the first day of life.  Late neonatal death is defined as any death of live newborn occurring days 8 through 28 after birth. ﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐After determining that a perinatal death has occurred, the initial notification should be done immediately (within 24 hours), by the fastest means possible The health facility should contact the district authority and provide information about the IDSR Case Alert form. Moreover, the health facility or the district perinatal death review committee is required to review the case within seven (7) days PDR should be anonymous. It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicableThe reports should not be used for disciplinary of litigation ﷐Recommended public health action﷐In many low-income countries, it is not possible to review all perinatal deaths given the large numbers of deaths and the limited capacity in human resources and time. However, it is important to accurately capture and classify the causes of those deathsSelected perinatal death should be reviewed and investigated to ascertain the cause.Surveillance for perinatal deaths should be conducted not just in the labour wards, but in the community, and all service areas where they occur.Response to any perinatal death is based on recommendations from the perinatal death review.Findings from review of the selected perinatal death should lead to actions to prevent similar deaths by identifying gaps that should be addressed at policy level and in both health facilities and communities.Monthly, quarterly or semi-annual analysis of aggregated data at larger health facilities and at district level  can lead to a more comprehensive approach  to address a particular problem across multiple facilities or communities or a problem in particular geographical areas where  they are occurring in greater numbers.

Construct secondary epidemic curves by cases classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, outliers, impact of interventions implemented.Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the geographical spread of the event. The visual interpretation of the maps can provide important etiological clues, identify clustering and provide details on the geographical extent of disease spread. Two types of maps are to be used:• Spot map – use spot maps to assess the likely mode of spread (cases clustered, scattering of cases, etc.)• Area map – use area maps to take into consideration the underlying population in that location (allows for direct comparison of incidence rates between sites, regions, etc.).Person: To understand the clinical spectrum and disease dynamics, it is necessary to analyse: • epidemiological and clinical parameters of the cases; • attack rates by age, sex, occupation and exposure history; and • for clinical parameters, the spectrum of illness severity, including proportion of cases with     pneumonia, those requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and the proportion that were fatal.Refer for more details to  WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 190, Content: Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation:Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb].Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case;Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month; Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal; Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other settingProbable case:  A suspected case with either: positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human.Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed casec Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.   d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9.

An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtypeRespond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:  Triggers for investigation  Examples of triggers include: respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals;clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks;SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases;SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections;SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens;number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected;laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen;abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; andunusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtypePrepare for the investigation- Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team- Inform relevant authorities- Gather information and suppliesInvestigate initial cases reportedProtect the investigatorsDevelop case definitionsFind additional cases- Identify and monitor contacts of cases- Active case findingEnhance surveillanceCollect specimensUndertake animal health and environmental investigationsManage and analyse the data (time, place, person)Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implementedImplement response and control measures- Manage the sick- Prevent further transmission- Infection prevention and control- Communicate the risk- Monitor the event and the responseReport and notify- Report results of the investigation- Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities.﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed:Manage the sick Prevent further transmissionInfection prevention and controlCommunicate the risk Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease  Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute        respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 194, Content: Background﷐Respiratory infections are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in the world. The mortality rates are particularly high among infants, children and the elderly. However, the burden of disease is not well characterized in Africa. The most common pathogens causing respiratory infections are; Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), influenza virusAn improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of respiratory infections in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).The threat of respiratory infections due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Surveillance for respiratory infections, mainly the viral ones, is based on the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) case definition. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐Describe the seasonality of influenza Signal the start and end of the influenza seasonEstablish baseline or average levels of influenza and severe influenza-related diseaseDescribe circulating virusesIdentify locally circulating virus types and subtypes and their relationship to global and regional patternsMonitor antiviral sensitivityIdentify and monitor groups at high-risk of severe disease and complications from infectionAssist in understanding the relationship of virus strains to disease severityGenerate influenza data that can be used to estimate influenza burdenDetect unusual and unexpected events﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with:measured fever ≥ 38 ºC coughwith onset within the last 10 days﷐Respond to an alert threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility.Person: For individual ILI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on ILI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting.

Q983,Why has Monkeypox become more prevalent since the eradication of smallpox?,"Monkeypox has become more prevalent due to the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination, leading to a lack of vaccine-induced immunity in younger people.",TG Booklet 6,230,"Monkeypox Prevalence, Smallpox Eradication, Discontinuation, Smallpox Vaccination, Vaccine-induced Immunity","Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 278, Content: NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.
Filename: TG Booklet 6, Paragraph(s) Number: 230, Content: Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.
