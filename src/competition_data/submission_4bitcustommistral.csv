It is characterized by recurrent seizures due to abnormal and paroxysmal electrical discharges in the brain. The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 50 million, with more than two-thirds living in developing countries. In the African Region, the prevalence is around 1-2%. Epilepsy may be caused by various factors, including genetic predisposition, perinatal trauma, and infections (e.g., malaria, meningitis). It can also result from central nervous system damage due to traumatic head injury, excessive consumption of alcohol or toxic substances, and other conditions."

Q873_question_answer," Hypertension, or high blood pressure (HBP), is a chronic condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is consistently elevated. It is classified into primary (essential) or secondary, depending on whether a medical cause is identified. Primary hypertension makes up the majority of cases, and secondary hypertension results from other conditions affecting the arteries, heart, endocrine system, or kidneys. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease-related deaths in the African Region accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the region in 2000. The prevalence of hypertension worldwide is estimated to be approximately 1 billion people, with more than 20 million people in the African Region affected. Major risk factors for hypertension include aging, lack of physical activity, obesity, a diet high in salt and fat, and other factors like tobacco and alcohol use. Life style modifications shown to lower BP include weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and increasing fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and decreasing alcohol and tobacco use."
