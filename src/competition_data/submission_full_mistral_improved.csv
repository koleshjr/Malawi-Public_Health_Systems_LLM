Q510_question_answer,"The interactions between the first case and healthcare workers might influence the development and spread of a respiratory illness in several ways. By visiting those places and talking to people who had contact with the patient, healthcare workers can identify potential cases and prevent further transmission. However, if proper infection control measures are not taken during these interactions, healthcare workers could also become infected or transmit the illness to others. Moreover, finding out about recent deaths and enquiring about the preparation of the dead before and during burial ceremonies is crucial for identifying potential sources of infection. Overall, effective communication and collaboration between healthcare workers and community members in conducting investigations can help contain the outbreak."

Q513_question_answer,"The common characteristics or factors contributing to the spread of respiratory illness during cases 5 through 13 in the second phase of the SARS outbreak include nosocomial transmission and a mean incubation period of 5 days with a range of 2-10 days.
Nosocomial transmission was a significant feature of the SARS outbreak as highlighted in this excerpt, 'The majority of the cases were adults. The case fatality ratio of SARS is estimated to range from 0% to more than 50% depending on the age group affected and reporting centre, with a crude global CFR of approximately 9.6%. The mean incubation period is 5 days, with the range of 2-10 days.' This suggests that during this phase, respiratory illness could easily spread in healthcare settings due to close contact between patients and healthcare workers.
Furthermore, the mean incubation period of 5 days with a range of 2-10 days indicates that individuals can spread the disease during their infectious period without showing symptoms or even before they develop symptoms. This prolonged infectiousness increases the likelihood of transmission during close contact."

Bacterial Meningitis is caused by various bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The diagnosis of Bacterial Meningitis relies on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC), cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF), and bacterial cultures.
On the other hand, Buruli Ulcer is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The diagnosis of Buruli Ulcer includes clinical assessment, radiological imaging, and laboratory tests such as cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Therefore, the similarity between these two conditions' laboratory confirmation methods lies in their reliance on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests for diagnosis. However, the key difference is that Bacterial Meningitis primarily involves bacterial cultures, while Buruli Ulcer involves both cultures and PCR."

Q822_question_answer,"Obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption are considered modifiable risk factors for diabetes because they can be changed or modified through individual behavior and community interventions.
Obesity is a significant risk factor for Type 2 diabetes due to the increased demand for insulin that results from excess body weight. Physical inactivity contributes to insulin resistance, which makes it harder for the body to use insulin effectively. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to obesity and pancreas damage, impairing the production of insulin.
Community awareness activities should target populations at high risk of developing diabetes or those already diagnosed with pre-diabetes, such as adults over 45 years of age, ethnic minorities, and individuals with a family history of diabetes."

Q837_question_answer,"The epidemiological pattern of Diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age differs from Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (SD1) and cholera primarily in the severity of disease, dehydration status, and resistance to antibiotics.

Diarrhea with dehydration in children is a common illness that can cause significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. It's characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. The dehydration status can range from mild to severe.

On the other hand, SD1 infections result in bloody diarrhoea, high fever, and can lead to severe dehydration, particularly in young children and elderly persons. The fatality rate can approach 20%. SD1 is frequently resistant to multiple antibiotics including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Cholera, another cause of diarrhea, is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration. It's transmitted through contaminated water or food.

Teaching mothers about home treatment with oral rehydration during outbreaks is essential because it can help prevent deaths caused by dehydration, particularly in young children who are the most vulnerable."

Q851_question_answer,"Maintaining strict infection prevention and control practices during an Ebola or Marburg outbreak is important to prevent the spread of the diseases. The viruses are transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, making infection prevention measures crucial. There is no specific treatment for either disease, requiring intensive supportive care for severe cases. For EVD, potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are being evaluated. Implementing immediate case-based reporting, analyzing age and sex distribution, assessing risk factors, planning disease control interventions, and constructing an epidemic curve during the outbreak are necessary actions to contain the spread of these viruses. Laboratory confirmation through diagnostic tests is essential for identifying infected individuals and isolating them to prevent further transmission.

Q886_question_answer,"The surveillance goals for influenza caused by a new subtype and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) have some similarities but also distinct differences.
For both, the primary goal is to monitor the seasonality of respiratory infections, signal the start and end of the influenza season, establish baseline levels of influenza and severe disease, describe circulating viruses, and identify locally circulating virus types and subtypes.
However, for influenza caused by a new subtype, additional goals include monitoring antiviral sensitivity and understanding the relationship of virus strains to disease severity. These goals are essential due to the potential epidemic or pandemic nature of new subtypes.
For ILI, there is also a focus on identifying and monitoring groups at high-risk of severe disease and complications from infection, assisting in understanding the relationship of virus strains to disease severity, and generating influenza data that can be used to estimate influenza burden. However, antiviral sensitivity monitoring is not specifically mentioned as a goal for ILI."

Q887_question_answer,"The standard case definitions for influenza caused by a new subtype differ from those for ILI (Influenza-like Illness) in several ways.

For influenza caused by a new subtype, specific case definitions may exist as seen with H5N1 and H7N9, whereas no such definition exists for ILI. Furthermore, an influenza A virus causing human infection by a new subtype is considered to have pandemic potential if it infects a human and its hemagglutinin gene is not a variant or mutated form of those circulating widely in the human population (A/H1 or A/H3). An infection with such a virus is considered recent if confirmed by positive PCR, virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic testing.

For ILI, there are no specific case definitions based on subtypes. Instead, it refers to any acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat."

Q888_question_answer,"The key steps for investigating influenza caused by a new subtype include confirming the case through positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. The investigation process also involves assessing the case against valid WHO case definitions. Triggers for investigation include respiratory disease in humans associated with recent exposure to animals, clusters of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces, or social networks, SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases, and SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections. 

Shared aspects between the investigation processes for influenza caused by a new subtype and influenza-like illness (ILI) include confirming cases through laboratory testing and assessing cases against valid case definitions. Distinct aspects of the investigation process for influenza caused by a new subtype include identifying triggers such as exposure to animals or travel from affected areas.

Q950_question_answer,"Maternal deaths should be analyzed in the community and all service areas where women are seen or die, as recommended in public health action.
It is important to analyze maternal deaths in this manner to ensure that every death of a woman of reproductive age is investigated to rule out pregnancy status, monitor trends, and respond appropriately based on recommendations from the Maternal Death Review.
This approach increases availability and use of antenatal care and skilled birth attendance, implements evidence-based high impact essential interventions for maternal health, educates and engages communities on emergency preparedness and complication readiness including evidence-based nutrition and dietary interventions for safe pregnancy and childbirth, and addresses socio-cultural norms and practices that negatively impact maternal health."
