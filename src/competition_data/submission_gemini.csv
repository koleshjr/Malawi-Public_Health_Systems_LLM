Q5_question_answer,"Community Based Surveillance (CBS) refers to the systematic and organized detection and reporting of public health events within the community by community members. This approach involves designated individuals, often referred to as focal persons, who are responsible for identifying and reporting cases or events to their local health delivery points."
Q5_reference_document,"TG Booklet 1, Paragraph(s) Number: 86, Content: Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of"

The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region. Varying degrees of success have been achieved in controlling TB where resources and motivation for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow up are adequate. Clinically, bacterial pneumonia, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS and a variety of other bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes of fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, or may themselves precipitate active TB in an already infected individual.')"
